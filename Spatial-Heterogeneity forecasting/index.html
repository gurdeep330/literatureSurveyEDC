        <tr id="Intratumoral variability is a seminal feature of human tumors contributing to tumor progression and response to treatment. Current technologies are unsuitable to accurately track phenotypes and subclonal evolution within tumors, especially in response to genetic manipulations. Here, we developed epitope combinatorial tags (EpicTags), which we coupled to multiplexed ion beam imaging (EpicMIBI) for in situ tracking of barcodes within tissue microenvironments. Using this platform, we dissected the spatial component of cell lineages and phenotypes in a xenograft model of small-cell lung cancer. We observed emergent properties from mixed clones leading to the preferential expansion of subclonal patches for both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancer cell states in this model. In tumors harboring a fraction of PTEN-deficient cancer cells, we uncovered a non-autonomous increase of subclonal patch size in PTEN wildtype cancer cells. EpicMIBI can facilitate in situ interrogation of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic processes involved in intratumoral heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest form of primary brain tumor with limited treatment options. Recent studies have profiled GBM tumor heterogeneity, revealing numerous axes of variation that explain the molecular and spatial features of the tumor. Here, we seek to bridge descriptive characterization of GBM cell type heterogeneity with the functional role of individual populations within the tumor. Our lens leverages a gene program-centric meta-atlas of published transcriptomic studies to identify commonalities between diverse tumors and cell types in order to decipher the mechanisms that drive them. This approach led to the discovery of a tumor-derived stem cell population with mixed vascular and neural stem cell features, termed a neurovascular progenitor (NVP). Following in situ validation and molecular characterization of NVP cells in GBM patient samples, we characterized their function in vivo. Genetic depletion of NVP cells resulted in altered tumor cell composition, fewer cycling cells, and extended survival, underscoring their critical functional role. Clonal analysis of primary patient tumors in a human organoid tumor transplantation system demonstrated that the NVP has dual potency, generating both neuronal and vascular tumor cells. Although NVP cells comprise a small fraction of the tumor, these clonal analyses demonstrated that they strongly contribute to the total number of cycling cells in the tumor and generate a defined subset of the whole tumor. This study represents a paradigm by which cell type-specific interrogation of tumor populations can be used to study functional heterogeneity and therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities of GBM.">

        <tr id="Resistance to cancer therapy is driven by both cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental factors. Previous work has revealed that multiple resistant cell fates emerge in melanoma following treatment with targeted therapy and that, in vitro, these resistant fates are determined by the transcriptional state of individual cells prior to exposure to treatment. What remains unclear is whether these resistant fates are shared across different genetic backgrounds and how, if at all, these resistant fates interact with the tumor microenvironment. Through spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we uncovered distinct resistance programs in melanoma cells shaped by both intrinsic cellular states and the tumor microenvironment. Consensus non-negative matrix factorization revealed shared intrinsic resistance programs across different cell lines, highlighting the presence of universal and unique resistance pathways. In patient samples, we demonstrated that these resistance programs coexist within individual tumors and associate with diverse immune signatures, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment and distribution of resistant fates are closely connected. Single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics in xenograft models revealed both intrinsically determined and extrinsically influenced resistant fates. Overall, this work demonstrates that each therapy resistant fate coexists with a distinct immune microenvironment in tumors and that, in vivo, tissue features, such as regions of necrosis, can influence which resistant fate is adopted.">

        <tr id="Spatial proteomics enable detailed analysis of tissue at single cell resolution. However, creating reliable segmentation masks and assigning accurate cell phenotypes to discrete cellular phenotypes can be challenging. We introduce IMmuneCite, a computational framework for comprehensive image pre-processing and single-cell dataset creation, focused on defining complex immune landscapes when using spatial proteomics platforms. We demonstrate that IMmuneCite facilitates the identification of 32 discrete immune cell phenotypes using data from human liver samples while substantially reducing nonbiological cell clusters arising from co-localization of markers for different cell lineages. We established its versatility and ability to accommodate any antibody panel and different species by applying IMmuneCite to data from murine liver tissue. This approach enabled deep characterization of different functional states in each immune compartment, uncovering key features of the immune microenvironment in clinical liver transplantation and murine hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, we demonstrated that IMmuneCite is a user-friendly, integrated computational platform that facilitates investigation of the immune microenvironment across species, while ensuring the creation of an immune focused, spatially resolved single-cell proteomic dataset to provide high fidelity, biologically relevant analyses.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive form of brain cancer that is highly resistant to therapy due to significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity. The lack of robust in vitro models to study early tumor progression has hindered the development of effective therapies. Here, we develop engineered GBM organoids (eGBOs) harboring GBM subtype-specific oncogenic mutations to investigate the underlying transcriptional regulation of tumor progression. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed that these mutations disrupt normal neurodevelopment gene regulatory networks resulting in changes in cellular composition and spatial organization. Upon xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, eGBOs form tumors that recapitulate the transcriptional and spatial landscape of human GBM samples. Integrative single-cell trajectory analysis of both eGBO-derived tumor cells and patient GBM samples revealed the dynamic gene expression changes in developmental cell states underlying tumor progression. This analysis of eGBOs provides an important validation of engineered cancer organoid models and demonstrates their utility as a model of GBM tumorigenesis for future preclinical development of therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies, like GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, are increasingly utilized to reveal the role of diverse tumor microenvironment components, particularly in relation to cancer progression, treatment response, and therapeutic resistance. However, in many ST studies, the spatial information obtained from immunofluorescence imaging is primarily used for identifying regions of interest, rather than as an integral part of downstream transcriptomic data interpretation. We developed ROICellTrack, a deep learning-based framework, to better integrate cellular imaging with spatial transcriptomic profiling. By examining 56 ROIs from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), ROICellTrack accurately identified cancer-immune mixtures and associated cellular morphological features. This approach also revealed different sets of spatial clustering patterns and receptor-ligand interactions. Our findings underscore the importance of combining imaging and transcriptomics for comprehensive spatial omics analysis, offering potential new insights into within-sample heterogeneity and implications for targeted therapies and personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) of medulloblastoma (MB) influences progression and therapy response, presenting a promising target for therapeutic advances. Prior single-cell analyses have characterized the cellular components of the TME but lack spatial context. To address this, we performed spatial transcriptomic sequencing on sixteen pediatric MB samples obtained at diagnosis, including two matched diagnosis-relapse pairs. Our analyses revealed inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity within the TME, comprised of tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs), macrophages (TAMs), stromal components, and distinct subpopulations of MB cells at different stages of neuronal differentiation and cell cycle progression. We identified dense regions of quiescent progenitor-like MB cells enriched in patients with high-risk (HR) features and an increase in TAAs, TAMs, and dysregulated vascular endothelium following relapse. Our study presents novel insights into the spatial architecture and cellular landscape of the medulloblastoma TME, highlighting spatial patterns linked to HR features and relapse, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets.">

Here, we identified senescent p16Ink4a+ cancer-associated fibroblasts with a secretory phenotype that promotes fatty acid uptake and utilization by aggressive lung adenocarcinoma driven by Kras and p53 mutations. Furthermore, rewiring of lung cancer metabolism by p16Ink4a+ cancer- associated fibroblasts also altered tumor cell identity to a highly plastic/dedifferentiated state associated with progression in murine and human LUAD. Our ex vivo senolytic screening platform identified XL888, a HSP90 inhibitor, that cleared p16Ink4a+ cancer- associated fibroblasts in vivo. XL888 administration after establishment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma significantly reduced tumor burden concurrent with the loss of plastic tumor cells. Our study identified a druggable component of the tumor stroma that fulfills the metabolic requirement of tumor cells to acquire a more aggressive phenotype.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a critical driver of tumor development and is linked to drug resistance and metastasis in solid malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that WGD is an ongoing mutational process in tumor evolution. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we measured and modeled how WGD events are distributed across cellular populations within tumors and associated WGD dynamics with properties of genome diversification and phenotypic consequences of innate immunity. We studied WGD evolution in 65 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tissue samples from 40 patients, yielding 29,481 tumor cell genomes. We found near-ubiquitous evidence of WGD as an ongoing mutational process promoting cell-cell diversity, high rates of chromosomal missegregation, and consequent micronucleation. Using a novel mutation-based WGD timing method, doubleTime, we delineated specific modes by which WGD can drive tumor evolution: (i) unitary evolutionary origin followed by significant diversification, (ii) independent WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy number diversity, and (iii) evolutionarily late clonal expansions of WGD populations. Additionally, through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signaling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability and are restricted to tumors that remain predominantly diploid. This contrasted with predominantly WGD tumors, which exhibited significant quiescent and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an evolutionarily ‘active’ mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in late stage ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) presents significant challenges due to its heterogeneity and late-stage diagnoses. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the complex landscape of HGSOC to understand its underlying mechanism. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-tumoral diversity, manifested through distinct cellular subpopulations and varied microenvironmental niches. Notably, our findings highlight a widespread immunosuppressive environment, marked by complex networks of cell-cell interactions, particularly evident in areas of elevated tumor cell density within metastatic samples. We identify the exclusive presence of COL14A1+ neoplastic cells in metastatic specimens, alongside a strong correlation between CD8A+ NKT cells and poor prognosis, and elevated CHODL expression in HGSOC metastasis tissues. Furthermore, knockdown experiments targeting CHODL demonstrate its role in reducing migration and invasion abilities in HGSOC cells. A pivotal discovery of our study is the delineation of specific cellular signatures correlated with adverse outcomes, notably a subset of CHODL+ neoplastic cells characterized by a distinct metabolic phenotype with a predilection for lipid metabolism. The therapeutic targeting of this metabolic pathway with existing inhibitors appears promising in curbing tumor proliferation. These findings enhance our understanding of HGSOC heterogeneity and reveal potential therapeutic targets, promising more effective management strategies for this aggressive cancer subtype.">

Here, we define patterns of metastatic seeding in prostate cancer (PCa) using a novel injection-based mouse model - EvoCaP (Evolution in Cancer of the Prostate), featuring aggressive metastatic cancer to bone, liver, lungs, and lymph nodes. To define migration histories between primary and metastatic sites, we used our EvoTraceR pipeline to track distinct tumor clones containing recordable barcodes. We detected widespread intratumoral heterogeneity from the primary tumor in metastatic seeding, with few clonal populations (CPs) instigating most migration. Metastasis-to-metastasis seeding was uncommon, as most cells remained confined within the tissue. Migration patterns in our model were congruent with human PCa seeding topologies. Our findings support the view of metastatic PCa as a systemic disease driven by waves of aggressive clones expanding their niche, infrequently overcoming constraints that otherwise keep them confined in the primary or metastatic site.">

        <tr id="The current challenge in analyzing sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) is to precisely resolve the spatial distribution of cell subpopulations with low abundance and detect context-dependent variation in cell states within complex tissue microenvironments. Here, we introduce an ultra-resolution ST deconvolution algorithm (UCASpatial) that improves the resolution of mapping cell subpopulations to spatial locations by leveraging the contribution of genes indicative of cell identity through entropy-based weighting. Using both in silico and real ST datasets, we demonstrate that UCASpatial improves the robustness and accuracy in identifying low-abundant cell subpopulations and distinguishing transcriptionally heterogeneous cell subpopulations. Applying UCASpatial to murine wound healing, we recapitulate known spatiotemporal dynamics of multiple cell subpopulations involved in wound healing and reveal the spatial segregation of distinct macrophage subpopulations embedded within different cellular communities at the wound center. In human colorectal cancer (CRC), we link genomic alterations in individual cancer clones to multi-cellular characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and reveal the co-evolution of tumor cells and TIME within the same tumor. We show that the copy number gain on chromosome 20q (chr20q-gain) in tumor cells orchestrates a T cell-excluded TIME, indicative of resistance to immunotherapy in CRC, and is associated with tumor-intrinsic endogenous retrovirus silencing and impaired type I interferon response. Our findings present UCASpatial as a versatile tool for deciphering ultra-resolution cellular landscapes in ST and exploring intercellular mechanisms in complex and dynamic microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Understanding the specific type of brain malignancy, source of brain metastasis, and underlying transformation mechanisms can help provide better treatment and less harm to patients. The tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in cancer progression and affects both primary and metastatic cancers. The use of single-cell RNA sequencing to gain insights into the heterogeneity profiles in the microenvironment of brain malignancies is useful for guiding treatment decisions. To comprehensively investigate the heterogeneity in gliomas and brain metastasis originating from different sources (lung and breast), we integrated data from three groups of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from GEO. We gathered and processed single-cell RNA sequencing data from 90,168 cells obtained from 17 patients. We then employed the R package Seurat for dataset integration. Next, we clustered the data within the UMAP space and acquired differentially expressed genes for cell categorization. Our results underscore the significance of macrophages as abundant and pivotal constituents of gliomas. In contrast, lung-to-brain metastases exhibit elevated numbers of AT2, cytotoxic CD4+ T, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. Conversely, breast-to-brain metastases are characterized by an abundance of epithelial and myCAF cells. Our study not only illuminates the variation in the TME between brain metastasis with different origins but also opens the door to utilizing established markers for these cell types to differentiate primary brain metastatic cancers.">

A custom data-analysis framework that combines spatial with single-cell transcriptomic profiling defined the BM cellular composition and established specific cell relations, visualizing the spatial distribution of transcriptionally heterogeneous MM plasma cells (MM-PC). MM pathogenesis transcriptional programs were spatially delineated within the BM microenvironment. A high-to-low MM-PC density gradient spatially correlated with effector-to-exhausted T cell phenotype abundance. In this context, MM cells in high-density MM-PC areas coexisted with dendritic cells while displaced neutrophils to the tumor border. Increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation, IL-17-driven inflammatory signaling, and osteoclast differentiation were spatially delineated within the BM microenvironment. The spatial identification of different areas of BM and the interaction between malignant cells and their microenvironment were validated in FFPE BM biopsies from MM patients with varying degrees of MM-PC infiltration. In summary, spatial transcriptomics depicts the BM cellular architecture of MM and reveals deregulated mechanisms underlying MM intercellular communication.">

        <tr id="Solid carcinomas are often highly heterogenous cancers, arising from multiple epithelial cells of origin. Yet, how the cell of origin influences the response of the tumor microenvironment is poorly understood. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) arises in the distal alveolar epithelium which is populated primarily by alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells. It has been previously reported that Gramd2+ AT1 cells can give rise to a histologically-defined LUAD that is distinct in pathology and transcriptomic identity from that arising from Sftpc+ AT2 cells1,2. To determine how cells of origin influence the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) landscape, we comprehensively characterized transcriptomic, molecular, and cellular states within the TIME of Gramd2+ AT1 and Sftpc+ AT2-derived LUAD using KRASG12D oncogenic driver mouse models. Myeloid cells within the Gramd2+AT1-derived LUAD TIME were increased, specifically, immunoreactive monocytes and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). In contrast, the Sftpc+ AT2 LUAD TIME was enriched for Arginase-1+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and TAMs expressing profiles suggestive of immunosuppressive function. Validation of immune infiltration was performed using flow cytometry, and intercellular interaction analysis between the cells of origin and major myeloid cell populations indicated that cell-type specific markers SFTPD in AT2 cells and CAV1 in AT1 cells mediated unique interactions with myeloid cells of the differential immunosuppressive states within each cell of origin mouse model. Taken together, Gramd2+ AT1-derived LUAD presents with an anti-tumor, immunoreactive TIME, while the TIME of Sftpc+ AT2-derived LUAD has hallmarks of immunosuppression. This study suggests that LUAD cell of origin influences the composition and suppression status of the TIME landscape and may hold critical implications for patient response to immunotherapy.">

We identify dependencies broadly enriched in BTC compared to other cancers as well as dependencies selective to the anatomic subtypes. Notably, cholangiocarcinoma cell lines are stratified into distinct lineage subtypes based on biliary or dual biliary/hepatocyte marker signatures, associated with dependency on specific lineage survival factors. Transcriptional analysis of patient specimens demonstrates the prognostic significance of these lineage subtypes. Additionally, we delineate strategies to enhance targeted therapies or to overcome resistance in cell lines with key driver gene mutations. Furthermore, clustering based on dependencies and proteomics data elucidates unexpected functional relationships, including a BTC subgroup with partial squamous differentiation. Thus, this cell line atlas reveals potential therapeutic targets in molecularly defined BTCs, unveils biologically distinct disease subtypes, and offers a vital resource for BTC research.">

        <tr id="Adult-type diffuse gliomas are a family of aggressive brain tumours with few effective treatments. Their complex cellular makeup adds to the challenge of finding successful therapies. This intratumoural heterogeneity is fuelled by a subpopulation of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) that drive tumour growth and resistance to standard treatments. Previous research focused on the three glioma types (astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma) individually revealed malignant cells mimic the transcriptional profiles of normal brain cell types. Whether these diverse cellular states stem from a shared biological origin is unknown. Here, we show through single-cell RNA sequencing of 40 glioma tumours that all gliomas are described by seven recurring cell states. We also identify a shared astrocyte-like GSC population. Our unique method of identifying GSCs, based on reconstructed tumour phylogenies, repositions astrocyte-like cells at the apex of a differentiation hierarchy in glioma. Our findings indicate the transcriptional heterogeneity observed in gliomas stems from a GSC population recapitulating lineages of healthy adult neural stem cells. These results suggest a shared lineage drives the intratumoural heterogeneity observed in adult-type diffuse gliomas. We anticipate that a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms maintaining the GSC state will provide a new framework for future therapeutic development and research into glioma cell biology.

In this investigation, we examined immune cell infiltration in 230 breast cancer samples, emphasizing diverse ethnic populations. Leveraging tissue microarrays (TMAs) and core samples, we applied multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to dissect immune cell subtypes across TME regions. Our analysis revealed distinct immune cell distribution patterns, particularly enriched in aggressive molecular subtypes triple-negative and HER2-positive tumors. We observed significant correlations between immune cell abundance and key clinicopathological parameters, including tumor size, lymph node involvement, and patient overall survival. Notably, immune cell location within different TME regions showed varying correlations with clinicopathologic parameters. Additionally, ethnicities exhibited diverse distributions of cells, with certain ethnicities showing higher abundance compared to others. In TMA samples, patients of Chinese and Caribbean origin displayed significantly lower numbers of B cells, TAMs, and FOXP3-positive cells. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between immune cells and breast cancer progression, with implications for personalized treatment strategies. Moving forward, integrating advanced imaging techniques, and exploring immune cell heterogeneity in diverse ethnic cohorts can uncover novel immune signatures and guide tailored immunotherapeutic interventions, ultimately improving breast cancer management.">

        <tr id="The molecular underpinnings of High Grade Endometrial Carcinoma (HGEC) metastatic growth and survival are poorly understood. Here we show that ascites-derived and primary tumor HGEC cell lines in 3D spheroid culture faithfully recapitulate key features of malignant peritoneal effusion and exhibit fundamentally distinct transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic landscapes when compared with conventional 2D monolayers. Using genetic screening platform we identify MAPK14 (which encodes the protein kinase p38α) as a specific requirement for HGEC in spheroid culture. MAPK14/p38α has broad roles in programing the phosphoproteome, transcriptome and metabolome of HGEC spheroids, yet has negligible impact on monolayer cultures. MAPK14 promotes tumorigenicity in vivo and is specifically required to sustain a sub-population of spheroid cells that is enriched in cancer stemness markers. Therefore, spheroid growth of HGEC activates unique biological programs, including p38α signaling, that cannot be captured using 2D culture models and are highly relevant to malignant disease pathology.">

        <tr id="Rationale: The heterogeneity of tumor cells within the glioblastoma (GBM) microenvironment presents a complex challenge in curbing GBM progression. Understanding the specific mechanisms of interaction between different GBM cell subclusters and non-tumor cells is crucial. Methods: In this study, we utilized a comprehensive approach integrating glioma single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. This allowed us to examine the molecular interactions and spatial localization within GBM, focusing on a specific tumor cell subcluster, GBM subcluster 6, and M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (M2 TAMs). Results: Our analysis revealed a significant correlation between a specific tumor cell subcluster, GBM cluster 6, and M2-type TAMs. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the specific regulatory role of the CEBPB transcriptional network in GBM subcluster 6, which governs its tumorigenicity, recruitment of M2 TAMs, and polarization. This regulation involves molecules such as MCP1 for macrophage recruitment and the SPP1-Integrin αvβ1-Akt signaling pathway for M2 polarization. Conclusion: Our findings not only deepen our understanding of the formation of M2 TAMs, particularly highlighting the differential roles played by heterogeneous cells within GBM in this process, but also provided new insights for effectively controlling the malignant progression of GBM.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal brain cancer with no effective treatment; understanding how GBM cells respond to tumor microenvironment remains challenging as conventional cell cultures lack proper cytoarchitecture while in vivo animal models present complexity all at once. Developing a culture system to bridge the gap is thus crucial. Here, we employed a multicellular approach using human glia and vascular cells to optimize a 3-dimensional (3D) brain vascular niche model that enabled not only long-term culture of patient derived GBM cells but also recapitulation of key features of GBM heterogeneity, in particular invasion behavior and vascular association. Comparative transcriptomics of identical patient derived GBM cells in 3D and in vivo xenotransplants models revealed that glia-vascular contact induced genes concerning neural/glia development, synaptic regulation, as well as immune suppression. This gene signature displayed region specific enrichment in the leading edge and microvascular proliferation zones in human GBM and predicted poor prognosis. Gene variance analysis also uncovered histone demethylation and xylosyltransferase activity as main themes for gene adaption of GBM cells in vivo. Furthermore, our 3D model also demonstrated the capacity to provide a quiescence and a protective niche against chemotherapy. In summary, an advanced 3D brain vascular model can bridge the gap between 2D cultures and in vivo models in capturing key features of GBM heterogeneity and unveil previously unrecognized influence of glia-vascular contact for transcriptional adaption in GBM cells featuring neural/synaptic interaction and immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Adenocarcinoma of the lung (LUAD) is a common and highly lethal disease. Clinical grading of disease strongly predicts recurrence and survival after surgery and is determined by morphological assessment of histological growth patterns in resected tumours. The molecular basis of growth pattern is poorly understood at present, as are the mechanisms linking growth pattern to recurrence and death. Interestingly, the two archetypal lethal morphologies, solid and micropapillary patterns, are characterised by their biphasic appearance. Both have an epithelial fraction which is in direct stromal contact, and a fraction which is not. This morphological variance seems likely to represent plasticity, and to be causally linked to mechanisms of virulence. To investigate the gene expression changes related to growth pattern both intra- and intertumoral, we applied spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to tissue microarray specimens of primary resected human lung adenocarcinoma. Using a variety of region-of-interest (ROI) selection strategies, we sampled 160 pure epithelial ROIs across 7 distinct morphological features of LUAD from 51 patients. Analyses of gene expression reveal fundamental trajectories connecting growth patterns, and crucial modes of plasticity which underly high-risk morphologies. These modes suggest mechanisms for the origins of growth pattern and mechanisms of virulence. Our work highlights dramatic divergence in gene expression programmes between highly lethal but morphologically diverse modes of tumour growth. Furthermore, it provides an explanation for how microscopically localised hypoxia in the primary tumour helps to establish and maintain survival strategies which ultimately determine morphology-specific mechanisms of tumour metastasis, suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Targeted therapies can induce strong tumor regression, but they typically fail to eradicate metastatic cancers. The elucidation of the causes that enable cancers to survive within a residual disease is essential for finding eradication strategies. The ability of cancers to survive eradication reflects not only cell-intrinsic sensitivities, but also microenvironmental effects. Paracrine signals produced by fibroblast, non-neoplastic cells that make tumor stroma, can provide strong but spatially limited therapy protection. Even though this phenomenon is well-established, its contribution to the ability of tumors to escape eradication remains poorly understood. To address this gap of knowledge, we developed an in silico model that recapitulates the effect of stroma on therapy responses in tumor tissues. This model enabled us to evaluate the contribution of spatial aspects of stroma-mediated resistance. Our analyses reveal that stroma dispersal might be the most important yet overlooked aspect of stromal resistance that determines the overall tumor responses to therapy. Abstract The response of tumors to anti-cancer therapies is defined not only by cell-intrinsic therapy sensitivities but also by local interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Fibroblasts that make tumor stroma have been shown to produce paracrine factors that can strongly reduce the sensitivity of tumor cells to many types of targeted therapies. Moreover, a high stroma/tumor ratio is generally associated with poor survival and reduced therapy responses. However, in contrast to advanced knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for stroma-mediated resistance, its effect on the ability of tumors to escape therapeutic eradication remains poorly understood. To a large extent, this gap of knowledge reflects the challenge of accounting for the spatial aspects of microenvironmental resistance, especially over longer time frames. To address this problem, we integrated spatial inferences of proliferation-death dynamics from an experimental animal model of targeted therapy responses with spatial mathematical modeling. With this approach, we dissected the impact of tumor/stroma distribution, magnitude and distance of stromal effects. While all of the tested parameters affected the ability of tumor cells to resist elimination, spatial patterns of stroma distribution within tumor tissue had a particularly strong impact.">

        <tr id="Tumor heterogeneity is a common hallmark of cancer and is considered a major cause of treatment failure and relapse, yet it remains poorly understood how various types of cells communicate within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to regulate tumor progression in vivo. Here we establish a tumor heterogeneity model in Drosophila eye epithelium by mutating the tricellular junction protein M6 in cells surrounding RasV12benign tumors and dissect the in vivo mechanisms underlying interclonal cooperation-induced malignancy by utilizing sophisticated genetic techniques in conjunction with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our findings reveal that loss of M6 facilitates the malignant transformation of neighboring RasV12 tumors by activating the Toll signaling, the innate immune response pathway. Notably, inhibiting Toll signaling impedes tumor progression, whereas its activation synergistically promotes RasV12 tumor malignancy by inactivating the Hippo pathway. Mechanistically, RasV12 tumors surrounded by M6 mutant clones lead to increased recruitment of hemocytes, which are the equivalent of macrophages in Drosophila, in a JNK pathway-dependent manner. Consequently, these tumor-associated macrophages secrete the Spatzle (Spz) ligand, which subsequently activates the Toll receptor within the RasV12 tumors, thereby triggering tumorigenesis. In summary, our study elucidates the complex in vivo interactions between genetically distinct oncogenic cells and between tumors and macrophages, shedding light on how macrophages exploit the innate immune signaling within tumors to regulate tumor heterogeneity and promote tumor progression. Significance statement Intratumoral heterogeneity profoundly affects cancer development and treatment in human tumors. The intricate nature of tumor cells and the presence of diverse cell types pose challenges to uncovering in vivo mechanisms responsible for heterogeneity. Our Drosophila tumor heterogeneity model reveals that fruit fly macrophages promotes both tumor heterogeneity and malignancy. Following recruitment by tumor cells, these macrophages secrete the ligand Spz to activate the Toll signaling pathway within tumor cells, which subsequently inactivates the Hippo pathway to drive tumorigenesis. Our study highlights the crucial role of hemocytes as intermediaries in coordinating tumor heterogeneity and facilitating intercellular communication between different cells within the TME.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have heralded a remarkable shift in cancer care, significantly extending survival for advanced cancer patients. However, despite their remarkable clinical successes, a substantial majority of patients fail to achieve a lasting response to ICIs. To address this challenge and gain insights into the complex landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME), we conducted an extensive analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA; ∼216K cells across 39 samples) and single-nucleus transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC; ∼43K cells from 15 samples) in a metastatic melanoma cohort. This systematic approach delineates 14 distinct cell types and 55 cell subtypes, including the identification of 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Through correlation analysis of cell subtype proportions, we unveiled six distinct clusters associated with varying tumor responses. Particularly intriguing was the identification of the mature DC enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) subtype exhibiting correlations with naive T and B cells, forming an anti-tumor program that underscores the importance of multiple immune cell types in mediating anti-tumor immunity. Notably, we found that mregDC abundance represents a good prognostic predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) in the context of ICI treatment, and when combined with the TCF7+/- CD8 T cell ratio, it reliably predicts patient PFS across treatments beyond ICI. We validated our findings using an independent cohort of 274 ICI-treated melanoma samples analyzed using tissue-level expression. We next compared mregDCs and conventional dendritic cell types 1 and 2 (cDC1 and cDC2) using transcriptome signature, differentiation trajectory, interactome, cytokine milieu, and epigenome landscape analyses. This comparative analysis shed light on the unique attributes of mregDCs within the TME. Finally, we investigated cell type/subtype-specific genes, pathways, immune response enrichment, and ligand-receptor interactions closely associated with the proportions of mregDCs within the TME. These molecular and cellular insights, with their critical roles in enhancing the immune response against cancer, offer valuable prospects for predicting the efficacy of ICI regimens, and potentially guiding the selection of rational combinatorial therapies.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, still most patients experience limited or no clinical benefit. The immune component dynamics during treatment and how it correlated with treatment efficacy remained largely known. We hypothesize that understanding the modulation dynamics of the TME upon ICI treatment would be key to elucidate the mechanisms of response and resistance. To systematically characterize these dynamics, we aggregated a large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of 141 patients across multiple cancer types and ICI treatment modalities, with longitudinally paired samples. We developed a robust, integration-free, and cluster-free deep phenotyping framework, leveraging multiple pan-cancer references to annotate 876,410 high-quality cells into 80 granular cell states. Our analysis revealed consistent compositional changes in 17 cell subtypes following ICI treatment, including an enhanced adaptive immune response such as CD8+ IL7R+ central memory T cells, GZMK+ effector memory T cells, germinal center B cells, precursor exhausted T cells, and CD4+ TfhTh1 cells, accompanied by a broad reduction in interferon responsive immune cells quiescent CD4+CREM-memory T cells. We uncovered co-regulated cell communities within the TME, highlighting the coordinated interplay between adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as immune and non-immune components. Furthermore, we identified two distinct patient groups exhibiting tightly correlated cellular dynamics within the TME post-treatment. The first group, enriched for responders, displayed a marked expansion of naive lymphocytes, while the second group, predominantly composed of non-responders, showed an increased abundance of immune experienced/suppressive cell states. This dichotomy in TME dynamics offers a potential predictive biomarker for patient stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies. Our study presents a comprehensive landscape of the cellular dynamics within the TME during ICI treatment, enabled by a powerful deep phenotyping approach showcasing the importance of a systems-level understanding of the TME dynamics in improving patient stratification and advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Intratumor heterogeneity has been shown to play a role in the malignant progression of cancer. Although clonal evolution in primary cancer has been well studied, that in metastatic tumorigenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we established human colon cancer-derived organoids and investigated clonal dynamics during liver metastasis development by tracking barcode-labelled subclones. Long-term subclone co-cultures showed clonal drift, with a single subclone becoming dominant in the cell population. Interestingly, the selected subclones were not always the same, suggesting that clonal selection was not based on cell intrinsic properties. Furthermore, liver tumors developed by co-transplantation of organoid subclones into the immunodeficient mouse spleen showed a progressive drastic reduction in clonal diversity, and only one or two subclones predominated in the majority of large metastatic tumors. Importantly, selections were not limited to particular subclones but appeared to be random. A trend towards a reduction in clonal diversity was also found in liver metastases of multiple color-labeled organoids of mouse intestinal tumors. Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism of metastasis development, i.e. a subclone population of the disseminated tumor cells in the liver is selected by neutral selection during colonization and constitutes large metastatic tumors.">

Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) combines AI driven single cell type analysis with laser microdissection and ultrasensitive mass spectrometry. In a composite case of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in a single patient, we investigated the potential of DVP to inform precision oncology. We quantified the proteomic landscapes in the cHL and SLL to a depth of thousands of proteins. Our analysis revealed distinct proteome profiles in cHL and SLL populations, highlighting their clonal unrelatedness. Our data suggested standardized chemotherapy and interleukin-4 inhibition as potential strategies to manage chemo-resistance – instead of bone marrow transplantation. DVP highlighted minichromosome maintenance protein and proteasome inhibitors for cHL and H3K27 methylation and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for SLL as subtype-specific treatments. Thus cell-type specific insights of DVP can guide personalized oncological treatments.">

        <tr id="Intra-tumor heterogeneity is an important driver of tumor evolution and therapy response. Advances in precision cancer treatment will require understanding of mutation clonality and subclonal architecture. Currently the slow computational speed of subclonal reconstruction hinders large cohort studies. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed Clonal structure identification through Pairwise Penalization, or CliPP, which clusters subclonal mutations using a regularized likelihood model. CliPP reliably processed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data from over 12,000 tumor samples within 24 hours, thus enabling large-scale downstream association analyses between subclonal structures and clinical outcomes. Through a pan-cancer investigation of 7,827 tumors from 32 cancer types, we found that high subclonal mutational load (sML), a measure of latency time in tumor evolution, was significantly associated with better patient outcomes in 16 cancer types with low to moderate tumor mutation burden (TMB). In a cohort of prostate cancer patients participating in an immunotherapy clinical trial, high sML was indicative of favorable response to immune checkpoint blockade. This comprehensive study using CliPP underscores sML as a key feature of cancer. sML may be essential for linking mutation dynamics with immunotherapy response in the large population of non-high TMB cancers.">

Understanding the intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity in SCLC is crucial for improving patient outcomes and clinically relevant subtyping. In this study, a spatial whole transcriptome-wide analysis of 25 SCLC patients at sub-histological resolution using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling technology is performed. This analysis deciphered intra-tumoral multi-regional heterogeneity, characterized by distinct molecular profiles, biological functions, immune features, and molecular subtypes within spatially localized histological regions. Connections between different transcript-defined intra-tumoral phenotypes and their impact on patient survival and therapeutic response are also established. Finally, a gene signature, termed ITHtyper, based on the prevalence of intra-tumoral heterogeneity levels, which enables patient risk stratification from bulk RNA-seq profiles is identified. The prognostic value of ITHtyper is rigorously validated in independent multicenter patient cohorts. This study introduces a preliminary tumor-centric, regionally targeted spatial transcriptome resource that sheds light on previously unexplored intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity in SCLC. These findings hold promise to improve tumor reclassification and facilitate the development of personalized treatments for SCLC patients.">

Herein, we present a compendium of matched chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and transcriptome (scRNA-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution from human breast tumors and healthy mammary tissues processed immediately following surgical resection. We identify the most likely cell-of-origin for luminal breast tumors and basal breast tumors and then introduce a novel methodology that implements linear mixed-effects models to systematically quantify associations between regions of chromatin accessibility (i.e. regulatory elements) and gene expression in malignant cells versus normal mammary epithelial cells. These data unveil regulatory elements with that switch from silencers of gene expression in normal cells to enhancers of gene expression in cancer cells, leading to the upregulation of clinically relevant oncogenes. To translate the utility of this dataset into tractable models, we generated matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles for breast cancer cell lines, revealing, for each subtype, a conserved oncogenic gene expression program between in vitro and in vivo cells. Together, this work highlights the importance of non-coding regulatory mechanisms that underlie oncogenic processes and the ability of single-cell multi-omics to define the regulatory logic of BC cells at single-cell resolution.">

        <tr id="Understanding transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer cells and its implication for treatment response is critical to identify how resistance occurs and may be targeted. Such heterogeneity can be captured by in vitro studies through clonal barcoding methods. We present TraCSED (Transformer-based modeling of Clonal Selection and Expression Dynamics), a dynamic deep learning approach for modeling clonal selection. Using single-cell gene expression and the fitness of barcoded clones, TraCSED identifies interpretable gene programs and the timepoints at which they are associated with clonal selection. When applied to cells treated with either giredestrant, an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist and degrader, or palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, time-dependent resistance pathways are revealed. For example, ER activity is associated with positive selection around day four under palbociclib treatment and this adaptive response can be suppressed by combining the drugs. Yet, in the combination treatment, one clone still emerged. Clustering based on partial least squares regression found that high baseline expression of both SNHG25 and SNCG genes was the primary marker of positive selection to co-treatment and thus potentially associated with innate resistance – an aspect that traditional differential analysis methods missed. In conclusion, TraCSED enables associating pathways with phenotypes in a time-dependent manner from scRNA-seq data.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Gastric cancer brain metastasis (GCBM) represents a rare but highly aggressive malignancy. Metastatic cancer cells are highly heterogeneous and differentially remodels brain vasculature and immune microenvironments, which affects the treatment effectiveness and patient outcome. This study aimed to investigate the spatial interactions among different cell components, especially the vasculature system and the brain microenvironment of GCBM patients. Methods We used digital spatial profiling to examine 140 regions composing tumor, immune, and brain tissues from three GCBM patients. Transcriptomic data with spatial information were analyzed for tissue areas related to different blood recruitment strategies. For validation, independent analysis of patient bulk transcriptomic data and in vivo single-cell transcriptomic data were performed. Results Angiogenesis and blood vessel co-option co-existed within the same GCBM lesion. Tumors with high epithelial-mesenchymal transition and an enhanced transcriptomic gene signature composed of CTNNB1, SPARC, VIM, SMAD3, SMAD4, TGFB1, TGFB2, and TGFB3 were more prone to adopt blood vessel co-option than angiogenesis. Enriched macrophage infiltration, angiogenic chemokines, and NAMPT were found in angiogenic areas, while increased T cells, T cell activating cytokines, and reduced NAMPT were found in vessel co-option regions. Spatially, angiogenesis was enriched at the tumor edge, which showed higher DMBT1 expression than the tumor center. Conclusions This study mapped the orchestrated spatial characteristics of tumor and immunological compositions that support the conventional and atypical vascularization strategies in GCBM. Our data provided molecular insights for more effective combinations of anti-vascular and immune therapies.">

        <tr id="The acidic tumor microenvironment favors cancer aggressiveness via incompletely understood pathways. Here, we asked whether acidic environments select for cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Bulk RNA-seq of Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells adapted to extracellular pH 6.5 revealed upregulation of CSC markers including CD44, EpCam, Nestin and aldehyde dehydrogenases, and CSC pathway enrichment. We therefore assessed CSC characteristics of acid-adapted (AA) and non-adapted (Ctrl) PaTu8988s and MiaPaca-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to Ctrl, AA cells exhibited increased ALDH- and β-catenin activity and pancreatosphere-forming efficiency, classical CSC characteristics. Panc-1, PaTu8988s and MiaPaCa-2 AA cells differed in CSC marker expression, and AA cells did not exhibit typical flow cytometric CSC populations. However, single-nucleus sequencing identified the acid adaptation-induced emergence of a population with clear CSC characteristics. Finally, in an orthotopic mouse model, AA Panc-1 cells drove strongly increased aggressiveness and liver metastasis compared to Ctrl cells. We conclude that acid-adaptation of pancreatic cancer cells leads to enrichment of a CSC phenotype with unusual traits, providing new insight into how acidic tumor microenvironments favor cancer aggressiveness.">

By incorporating a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and differential expression gene (DEGs) analysis, CLADES yields cell division dynamics across differentiation timecourses and fate bias predictions for the early progenitor cells. Moreover, clone-level quantitative behaviours can be grouped into characteristic types by pooling individual clones into meta-clones. By benchmarking with CoSpar, we found that CLADES improves fate bias prediction accuracy at the meta-clone level. In conclusion, we report a broadly applicable approach to robustly quantify differentiation kinetics using meta-clones while providing valuable insights into the fate bias of cellular populations for any organ system maintained by a pool of heterogeneous stem and progenitor cells.">

Current treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, and immunotherapy, offer limited success, with immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) being the most promising. However, the high mortality rate underscores the urgent need for robust, non-invasive biomarkers to predict patient response to adjuvant therapies. The immune microenvironment of melanoma comprises various immune cells, which influence tumor growth and immune response. Melanoma cells employ multiple mechanisms for immune escape, including defects in immune recognition and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which collectively impact treatment efficacy. Single-cell analysis technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have revolutionized the understanding of tumor heterogeneity and immune microenvironment dynamics. These technologies facilitate the identification of rare cell populations, co-expression patterns, and regulatory networks, offering deep insights into tumor progression, immune response, and therapy resistance. In the realm of biomarker discovery for melanoma, single-cell analysis has demonstrated significant potential. It aids in uncovering cellular composition, gene profiles, and novel markers, thus advancing diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Additionally, tumor-associated antibodies and specific genetic and cellular markers identified through single-cell analysis hold promise as predictive biomarkers. Despite these advancements, challenges such as RNA-protein expression discrepancies and tumor heterogeneity persist, necessitating further research. Nonetheless, single-cell analysis remains a powerful tool in elucidating the mechanisms underlying therapy response and resistance, ultimately contributing to the development of personalized melanoma therapies and improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This study investigates the role of visual intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in breast cancer progression. By analyzing histologic images from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS) and the Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) data using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, we developed a measure of tumor heterogeneity based on visual features. Our findings indicate that tumors with low visual heterogeneity exhibited a higher risk of recurrence and were more likely to come from patients whose tumors comprised of only one subclone or had a TP53 mutation. Conversely, high visual heterogeneity was correlated with a more favorable prognosis. These results suggest that visual heterogeneity provides complementary information to molecular markers. A comprehensive understanding of both the visual and molecular aspects of heterogeneity has the potential to offer novel insights for treatment strategies. Abstract High intratumoral heterogeneity is thought to be a poor prognostic indicator. However, the source of heterogeneity may also be important, as genomic heterogeneity is not always reflected in histologic or ‘visual’ heterogeneity. We aimed to develop a predictor of histologic heterogeneity and evaluate its association with outcomes and molecular heterogeneity. We used VGG16 to train an image classifier to identify unique, patient-specific visual features in 1655 breast tumors (5907 core images) from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). Extracted features for images, as well as the epithelial and stromal image components, were hierarchically clustered, and visual heterogeneity was defined as a greater distance between images from the same patient. We assessed the association between visual heterogeneity, clinical features, and DNA-based molecular heterogeneity using generalized linear models, and we used Cox models to estimate the association between visual heterogeneity and tumor recurrence. Basal-like and ER-negative tumors were more likely to have low visual heterogeneity, as were the tumors from younger and Black women. Less heterogeneous tumors had a higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval = 1.22–2.16), and were more likely to come from patients whose tumors were comprised of only one subclone or had a TP53 mutation. Associations were similar regardless of whether the image was based on stroma, epithelium, or both. Histologic heterogeneity adds complementary information to commonly used molecular indicators, with low heterogeneity predicting worse outcomes. Future work integrating multiple sources of heterogeneity may provide a more comprehensive understanding of tumor progression.">

 Therapeutics targeting tumor endothelial cells (TECs) have been explored for decades, with only suboptimal efficacy achieved, partly due to an insufficient understanding of the TEC heterogeneity across cancer patients. We integrated single-cell RNA-seq data of 575 cancer patients from 19 solid tumor types, comprehensively charting the TEC phenotypic diversities. Our analyses uncovered underappreciated compositional and functional heterogeneity in TECs from a pan-cancer perspective. Two subsets, CXCR4+ tip cells and SELE+ veins, represented the prominent angiogenic and proinflammatory phenotypes of TECs, respectively. They exhibited distinct spatial organization patterns, and compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, tumor tissue showed an increased prevalence of CXCR4+ tip cells, yet with SELE+ veins depleted. Such functional and spatial characteristics underlie their differential associations with the response of anti-angiogenic therapies and immunotherapies. Our integrative resources and findings open new avenues to understand and clinically intervene in the tumor vasculature.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) displays an infiltrative growth characteristic that recruits neighboring normal cells to facilitate tumor growth, maintenance, and invasion into the brain. While the blood-brain barrier serves as a critical natural defense mechanism for the central nervous system, GBM disrupts this barrier, resulting in the infiltration of macrophages from the peripheral bone marrow and the activation of resident microglia. Recent advancements in single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics have refined the categorization of cells within the tumor microenvironment for precise identification. The intricate interactions and influences on cell growth within the tumor microenvironment under multi-omics conditions are succinctly outlined. The factors and mechanisms involving microglia, macrophages, endothelial cells, and T cells that impact the growth of GBM are individually examined. The collaborative mechanisms of tumor cell-immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment synergistically promote the growth, infiltration, and metastasis of gliomas, while also influencing the immune status and therapeutic response of the tumor microenvironment. As immunotherapy continues to progress, targeting the cells within the inter-tumor microenvironment emerges as a promising novel therapeutic approach for GBM. By comprehensively understanding and intervening in the intricate cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment, novel therapeutic modalities may be developed to enhance treatment outcomes for patients with GBM.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary In our study, we investigated immune regulation in a subtype of lymphoma called mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Our goal was to understand how different types of immune cells, specifically T cells, behave in MCL. To do this, we combined image analysis and a technology called digital spatial profiling. We looked at tumor tissue from 102 MCL patients and analyzed different T-cell subsets. Interestingly, we found that late-stage differentiated T cells (CD57+) were more common in tumor-rich areas. These T cells also showed an increased expression of immune suppressive markers. We identified potential targets for treatment, such as CD47, IDO1, and CTLA-4. Additionally, we found that patients with sparse T-cell infiltration had an increased amount of GITR, which tentatively can be therapeutically targeted. Our findings shed light on previously unknown features of T-cell behavior in MCL. Abstract With the aim to advance the understanding of immune regulation in MCL and to identify targetable T-cell subsets, we set out to combine image analysis and spatial omic technology focused on both early and late differentiation stages of T cells. MCL patient tissue (n = 102) was explored using image analysis and GeoMx spatial omics profiling of 69 proteins and 1812 mRNAs. Tumor cells, T helper (TH) cells and cytotoxic (TC) cells of early (CD57−) and late (CD57+) differentiation stage were analyzed. An image analysis workflow was developed based on fine-tuned Cellpose models for cell segmentation and classification. TC and CD57+ subsets of T cells were enriched in tumor-rich compared to tumor-sparse regions. Tumor-sparse regions had a higher expression of several key immune suppressive proteins, tentatively controlling T-cell expansion in regions close to the tumor. We revealed that T cells in late differentiation stages (CD57+) are enriched among MCL infiltrating T cells and are predictive of an increased expression of immune suppressive markers. CD47, IDO1 and CTLA-4 were identified as potential targets for patients with T-cell-rich MCL TIME, while GITR might be a feasible target for MCL patients with sparse T-cell infiltration. In subgroups of patients with a high degree of CD57+ TC-cell infiltration, several immune checkpoint inhibitors, including TIGIT, PD-L1 and LAG3 were increased, emphasizing the immune-suppressive features of this highly differentiated T-cell subset not previously described in MCL.">

        <tr id="Single-cell spatial omics analysis requires consideration of biological functions and mechanisms in a microenvironment. However, microenvironment analysis using bioinformatic methods is limited by the need to detect histological morphology. In this study, we developed SpatialKNife (SKNY), an image-processing-based toolkit that detects spatial domains that potentially reflect histology and extends these domains to the microenvironment. The SKNY algorithm identified tumour spatial domains from spatial transcriptomic data of breast cancer, followed by clustering of these domains, trajectory estimation, and spatial extension to the tumour microenvironment (TME). The results of the trajectory estimation were consistent with the known mechanisms of cancer progression. We observed endothelial cell and macrophage infiltration into the TME at mid-stage progression. Our results suggest that analysis using the spatial domain as a unit reflects pathological mechanisms in the TME. This approach may be applicable to the biological estimation of diverse microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogeneous population of cells whose phenotypes and functions are shaped by factors that are incompletely understood. Herein, we asked when and where TAMs arise from blood monocytes and how they evolve during tumor development. We initiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in inducible monocyte fate-mapping mice and combined single-cell transcriptomics and high-dimensional flow cytometry to profile the monocyte-to-TAM transition. We revealed that monocytes differentiate first into a transient intermediate population of TAMs that generates two longer-lived lineages of terminally differentiated TAMs with distinct gene expression profiles, phenotypes, and intratumoral localization. Transcriptome datasets and tumor samples from patients with PDAC evidenced parallel TAM populations in humans and their prognostic associations. These insights will support the design of new therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs in PDAC. Intermediate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) emerge first and give rise to two more differentiated TAM populations in pancreatic cancer. Editor’s summary Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and immune suppression, but how TAMs develop from circulating monocytes and local tissue-resident macrophages remains incompletely understood. Using a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in monocyte fate-mapping mice, Dunsmore et al. examined the dynamics of the monocyte-to-macrophage transition in tumors. A population of “intermediate” TAMs gave rise to two more differentiated TAM subsets, distinguishable by their distinct surface marker phenotype, dependence on the transcription factor Maf, migratory behavior, and localization in tumors. These findings provide a time- and space-resolved picture of TAM heterogeneity and development in PDAC, which could guide the future development of TAM-targeted therapeutic strategies. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Background. Interactions among tumor, immune, and vascular niches play major roles in driving glioblastoma (GBM) malignancy and treatment responses. The composition, heterogeneity, and localization of extracellular core matrix proteins (CMPs) that mediate such interactions, however, are not well understood. Methods. Here, through computational genomics and proteomics approaches, we analyzed the functional and clinical relevance of CMP expression in GBM at bulk, single cell, and spatial anatomical resolution. Results. We identified genes encoding CMPs whose expression levels categorize GBM tumors into CMP expression-high (M-H) and CMP expression-low (M-L) groups. CMP enrichment is associated with worse patient survival, specific driver oncogenic alterations, mesenchymal state, infiltration of pro-tumor immune cells, and immune checkpoint gene expression. Anatomical and single-cell transcriptome analyses indicate that matrisome gene expression is enriched in vascular and leading edge/infiltrative niches that are known to harbor glioma stem cells driving GBM progression. Finally, we identified a 17-gene CMP expression signature, termed Matrisome 17 (M17) signature that further refines the prognostic value of CMP genes. The M17 signature is a significantly stronger prognostic factor compared to MGMT promoter methylation status as well as canonical subtypes, and importantly, potentially predicts responses to PD1 blockade. Conclusion. The matrisome gene expression signature provides a robust stratification of GBM patients by survival and potential biomarkers of functionally relevant GBM niches that can mediate mesenchymal-immune cross talk. Patient stratification based on matrisome profiles can contribute to selection and optimization of treatment strategies.">

 Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are heterogeneous and highly aggressive hematologic malignancies with dismal outcomes, highlighting the need for novel targeted therapies. PTCLs are characterized by complex tumor-microenvironment (TME) ecosystems with low tumor cell content, admixed with rich immune infiltrates and stromal elements correlated with clinical outcomes. Direct targeting of the TME is an attractive strategy for PTCLs; however, the specific mechanisms that regulate the interdependence between lymphoma and TME remain poorly understood, hampering the development of TME-directed therapies. Our previous work based on driver genetic alterations in PTCL patients and genetic mouse models identified an important role of these driver mutations in remodeling the TME (Cortes et al., 2022). To address the specific role and mechanisms of tumor cell-TME interactions in the pathogenesis of PTCL, we developed a novel experimental platform and cutting-edge computational methodologies using single-nucleus RNAseq analysis to comprehensively profile lymphoma cells and their microenvironment from 27 PTCL patient samples of two major nodal pathologic subtypes, including 18 Nodal T follicular helper cell lymphomas (TFHcL) and 9 PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS). Our approach allowed the identification and in-depth characterization of tumor cells, lymphoid and myeloid TME, and vascular endothelium and non-endothelial stromal cells, which were challenging to capture with conventional single-cell RNAseq. The malignant T-cells in PTCL, NOS were grouped into patient-specific clusters demonstrating significant inter-tumor heterogeneity associated with diverse and frequently complex chromosomal abnormalities identified by copy number variation (CNV) analysis. In contrast, malignant TFHcL cells show a low degree to no apparent chromosomal abnormalities and divide into two major transcriptional subclusters, with tumor cells from the same patient falling into one of the two subclusters. Additionally, genomic profiles of TFHcL tumors revealed that the inter-tumor transcriptional heterogeneity of TFHcL tumor cells was strongly associated with the driver RHOA G17V mutation status. To profile oncogenic pathways critical for PTCL growth, we compared PTCL tumor cells to normal CD4 T-cells from reactive lymphoid tissue. PTCL, NOS and TFHcL tumor cells were equally enriched in the TCR signaling pathway, mitosis, and cell cycle related genes. However, exploitation of KRAS and cytokine-driven inflammatory signals was prevalent in TFHcL but not PTCL, NOS tumor cells. Analysis of the immune TME identified an increase in T regulatory cells, CD8 T-cells, immunoblasts, and macrophages in TFHcL. Furthermore, while dysregulated B-cells with heightened cytokine-driven inflammatory signals were unique to TFHcL, inflammatory macrophages and classic dendritic cells (cDC) were prominent in the TME of both subtypes. Our results uncover shared and subtype-specific pathogenic features in PTCL and pave the way for designing novel precision therapies for PTCL patients.

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Non‐small‐cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most prevalent and lethal form of lung cancer. The need for biomarker‐informed stratification of targeted therapies has underpinned the need to uncover the underlying properties of the tumor microenvironment (TME) through high‐plex quantitative assays. Methods In this study, we profiled resected NSCLC tissues from 102 patients by targeted spatial proteomics of 78 proteins across tumor, immune activation, immune cell typing, immune‐oncology, drug targets, cell death and PI3K/AKT modules to identify the tumor and stromal signatures associated with overall survival (OS). Results Survival analysis revealed that stromal CD56 (HR = 0.384, P = 0.06) and tumoral TIM3 (HR = 0.703, P = 0.05) were associated with better survival in univariate Cox models. In contrast, after adjusting for stage, BCLXL (HR = 2.093, P = 0.02) and cleaved caspase 9 (HR = 1.575, P = 0.1) negatively influenced survival. Delta testing indicated the protective effect of TIM‐3 (HR = 0.614, P = 0.04) on OS. In multivariate analysis, CD56 (HR = 0.172, P = 0.001) was associated with better survival in the stroma, while B7.H3 (HR = 1.72, P = 0.008) was linked to poorer survival in the tumor. Conclusions Deciphering the TME using high‐plex spatially resolved methods is giving us new insights into compartmentalised tumor and stromal protein signatures associated with clinical endpoints in NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality rates continue to increase faster than those of other cancer types due to high heterogeneity, which limits diagnosis and treatment. Pathological and molecular subtyping have identified that HCC tumors with poor outcomes are characterized by intratumoral collagenous accumulation. However, the translational and post-translational regulation of tumor collagen, which is critical to the outcome, remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the spatial extracellular proteome to understand the differences associated with HCC tumors defined by Hoshida transcriptomic subtypes of poor outcome (Subtype 1; S1; n = 12) and better outcome (Subtype 3; S3; n = 24) that show differential stroma-regulated pathways. Collagen-targeted mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with the same-tissue reference libraries, built from untargeted and targeted LC-MS/MS was used to spatially define the extracellular microenvironment from clinically-characterized, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Collagen α-1(I) chain domains for discoidin-domain receptor and integrin binding showed distinctive spatial distribution within the tumor microenvironment. Hydroxylated proline (HYP)-containing peptides from the triple helical regions of fibrillar collagens distinguished S1 from S3 tumors. Exploratory machine learning on multiple peptides extracted from the tumor regions could distinguish S1 and S3 tumors (with an area under the receiver operating curve of ≥0.98; 95% confidence intervals between 0.976 and 1.00; and accuracies above 94%). An overall finding was that the extracellular microenvironment has a high potential to predict clinically relevant outcomes in HCC.">

Selection of patients most likely to benefit from these therapies requires an understanding of how expression of these cell surface antigens varies across patients and how they change during disease progression, particularly in tumors that undergo lineage plasticity. Using immunohistochemistry and single-cell mRNA sequencing, we reveal heterogeneity of cell states across a cohort of advanced disease prostate cancer patients; this heterogeneity is not captured by conventional histology-based designations of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. We show that these cell states can be identified by gene regulatory networks that could provide additional diagnostic precision based on their correlation with clinically relevant cell surface antigen expression.">

Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive pediatric malignancy originating from defective differentiation of neural crest– derived progenitors with oncogenic activity due to genetic and epigenetic alterations and remains a clinical challenge for high-risk patients. To identify critical genes driving NB aggressiveness, we performed combined chromatin and transcriptome analyses on matched patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), spheroids, and differentiated adherent cultures derived from metastatic MYCN nonamplified tumors. Bone marrow kinase on chromosome X (BMX) was identified among the most differentially regulated genes in PDXs and spheroids versus adherent models. BMX expression correlated with high tumor stage and poor patient survival and was crucial to the maintenance of the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of NB spheroids. Moreover, BMX expression positively correlated with the mesenchymal NB cell phenotype, previously associated with increased chemoresistance. Finally, BMX inhibitors readily reversed this cellular state, increased the sensitivity of NB spheroids toward chemotherapy, and partially reduced tumor growth in a preclinical NB model. Altogether, our study identifies BMX as a promising innovative therapeutic target for patients with high-risk MYCN nonamplified NB.">

        <tr id="Tumors have a complex metabolism that differs from most metabolic processes in healthy tissues. It is highly dynamic and driven by the tumor cells themselves, as well as by the non‐transformed stromal infiltrates and immune components. Each of these cell populations has a distinct metabolism that depends on both their cellular state and the availability of nutrients. Consequently, to fully understand the individual metabolic states of all tumor‐forming cells, correlative mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) up to cellular resolution with minimal metabolite shift needs to be achieved. By using a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) equipped with an Orbitrap mass analyzer, we present a workflow to image primary murine tumor tissues up to cellular resolution and correlate these ion images with post acquisition immunofluorescence or histological staining. In a murine breast cancer model, we could identify metabolic profiles that clearly distinguish tumor tissue from stromal cells and immune infiltrates. We demonstrate the robustness of the classification by applying the same profiles to an independent murine model of lung cancer, which is accurately segmented by histological traits. Our pipeline allows metabolic segmentation with simultaneous cell identification, which in the future will enable the design of subpopulation‐targeted metabolic interventions for therapeutic purposes.">

Targeted therapies have improved the clinical outcomes of most patients
with cancer. However, the heterogeneity of gastric cancer remains a major hurdle for precision
treatment. Further investigations into tumor microenvironment heterogeneity are required to resolve
these problems.



In this study, bioinformatic analyses, including metabolism analysis, pathway enrichment,
differentiation trajectory inference, regulatory network construction, and survival analysis,
were applied to gain a comprehensive understanding of tumor microenvironment biology within
gastric cancer using single-cell RNA-seq and public datasets and experiments were carried out to
confirm the conclusions of these analyses.



We profiled heterogeneous single-cell atlases and identified eight cell populations with
differential expression patterns. We identified two cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subtypes,
with particular emphasis on the role of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs) in
EMT and lipid metabolic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, we detected two
differentiation states of iCAFs that existed in different tissues with discrepant expression of genes
involved in immuno-inflammation or ECM remodeling. Moreover, investigation of tumor-infiltrating
myeloid cells has revealed the functional diversity of myeloid cell lineages in gastric cancer.
Of which a proliferative cell lineage named C1QC+MKI67+TAMs was recognized with high immunosuppressive
capacities, suggesting it has immune suppression and cell proliferation functions
in the tumor niche. Finally, we explored regulatory networks based on ligand-receptor pairs and
found crucial pro-tumor crosstalk between CAFs and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment
(TME).



These findings provide insights for future cancer treatments and drug discovery

This study enrolled 31 HNSCC patients for the establishment of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs), which faithfully maintained genomic features and histopathological traits of primary tumors. Long-term culture preserved key characteristics, affirming PDOs as robust representative models. PDOs demonstrated predictive capability for cisplatin treatment responses, correlating ex vivo drug sensitivity with patient outcomes. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled molecular subtypes and intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in PDOs, paralleling patient tumors. Notably, a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (hEMT)-like ITH program is associated with cisplatin resistance and poor patient survival. Functional analyses identified amphiregulin (AREG) as a potential regulator of the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state. Moreover, AREG contributes to cisplatin resistance via EGFR pathway activation, corroborated by clinical samples. In summary, HNSCC PDOs serve as reliable and versatile models, offer predictive insights into ITH programs and treatment responses, and uncover potential therapeutic targets for personalized medicine. One Sentence Summary This study establishes patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from 31 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, faithfully recapitulating characteristics of primary tumors and accurately predicting clinical responses to cisplatin treatment.

While deep learning is increasingly used, it is difficult to generalize due to variability at the level of cells, neighborhoods, and niches in health and disease. To address this, we developed TACIT, an unsupervised algorithm for cell annotation using predefined signatures that operates without training data. TACIT uses unbiased thresholding to distinguish positive cells from background, focusing on relevant markers to identify ambiguous cells in multiomic assays. Using five datasets (5,000,000-cells; 51-cell types) from three niches (brain, intestine, gland), TACIT outperformed existing unsupervised methods in accuracy and scalability. Integrating TACIT-identified cell types with a novel Shiny app revealed new phenotypes in two inflammatory gland diseases. Finally, using combined spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, we discovered under- and overrepresented immune cell types and states in regions of interest, suggesting multimodality is essential for translating spatial biology to clinical applications.">

To enable complementary functional studies, we developed a scalable approach for recapitulating cell states in vitro using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) Perturb-seq. Aided by a novel multiplexing method, we activated 1,836 transcription factors in two cell types. Measuring 21,958 perturbations showed that CRISPRa activated targets within physiological ranges, that epigenetic features predicted activatable genes, and that the protospacer seed region drove an off-target effect. Perturbations recapitulated in vivo fibroblast states, including universal and inflammatory states, and identified KLF4 and KLF5 as key regulators of the universal state. Inducing the universal state suppressed disease-associated states, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Our findings cement CRISPRa as a tool for perturbing differentiated cells and indicate that in vivo states can be elicited via perturbation, enabling studies of clinically relevant states ex vivo.">

        <tr id="Local inflammation in the pancreas is transient but imprints a durable epigenetic memory on epithelial cells, making them more amenable to oncogenic transformation. However, it is unclear whether epithelial cell heterogeneity is impacted by acute pancreatitis (AP) or whether population dynamics during regeneration contributes to the establishment of inflammation memory. To tackle those questions, we deployed experimental pancreatitis in mice and performed paired sequencing of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles at single nucleus resolution. We documented cell type abundance but also applied integrative analyses to infer phenotypically-distinct clusters of mesenchymal and exocrine cells. We found that AP perturbs a subset of “idling” acinar cells, which separate from more canonical “secretory” acini based on a more diversified proteome, which include elevated expression of signal transduction receptors. We linked acinar cell heterogeneity to epigenetic differences that also endow idling cells with superior plasticity. These constitute about 40% of acinar cells but can proliferate and skew their phenotype in response to AP. This leads to a remarkable recovery of pancreas histology and function, but also to the dissemination of idling-like features across the exocrine parenchyma. Mechanistically, idling acinar cells are characterized by enhanced transcriptional activity and protein synthesis. After recovery from pancreatitis, acini show elevation of both and establishment of chronic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). We finally demonstrated that AP-primed pancreata show signs of elevated UPR and that ER stress promotes acinar cell metaplasia. Our data interrogate phenotypical dynamics during tissue regeneration to identify cell states amenable to epigenetic imprinting. They also suggest that UPR-alleviating strategies might curtail the risk of developing pancreatic cancer for individuals who experiences AP.">

        <tr id="Abstract Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors with varying therapeutic response and prognosis, and evidence suggests the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a pivotal role. Using advanced molecular and spatial biology technologies, we aimed to evaluate the TIME in patients with CRC to determine whether specific alterations in the immune composition correlated with prognosis. We identified primary and metastatic tumor samples from 31 consented patients, which were profiled with whole-exome sequencing and bulk RNA-seq. Immune cell deconvolution followed by gene set enrichment analysis and unsupervised clustering was performed. A subset of tumors underwent in situ analysis of the TIME spatial composition at single-cell resolution through Imaging Mass Mass Cytometry. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed two distinct groups of advanced CRC, one with an immune activated phenotype and the other with a suppressed immune microenvironment. The activated TIME phenotype contained increased Th1 cells, activated dendritic cells, tertiary lymphoid structures, and higher counts of CD8+ T cells whereas the inactive or suppressed TIME contained increased macrophages and a higher M2/M1 ratio. Our findings were further supported by RNA-seq data analysis from the TCGA CRC database, in which unsupervised clustering also identified two separate groups. The immunosuppressed CRC TIME had a lower overall survival probability (HR 1.66, p=0.007). This study supports the pertinent role of the CRC immune microenvironment in tumor progression and patient prognosis. We characterized the immune cell composition to better understand the complexity and vital role that immune activity states of the TIME play in determining patient outcome.">

Choosing the most efficacious treatment for a patient remains a challenge in such cancers. However, pre-clinical assays involving patient-derived tumor cells co-cultured in an ex vivo reconstruction of immune-tumor micro-environment have gained considerable notoriety over the past decade. Such assays can characterize a patient’s response to several therapeutic agents including immunotherapies in a high-throughput manner, where bright-field images of tumor (target) cells interacting with effector cells (T cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and macrophages) are captured once every 30 minutes for upto six days. Cell detection, tracking, and classification of thousands of cells of two or more types in each frame is bound to test the limits of some of the most advanced computer vision tools developed to date and requires a specialized approach.

However, the spatial molecular structural alterations contributing to postoperative recurrence in HCC are still poorly understood.


APPROACH RESULTS
We employed imaging mass cytometry to profile the in-situ expression of 33 proteins within 358,729 single cells of 92 clinically annotated surgical specimens from 46 patients who were treated with surgical resections for primary and relapsed tumors. We revealed the recurrence progression of HCC was governed by the dynamic spatial distribution and functional interplay of diverse cell types across adjacent normal, tumor margin, and intratumor regions. Our exhaustive analyses revealed an aggressive, immunosuppression-related spatial ecosystem in relapsed HCC. Additionally, we illustrated the prominent implications of the TME of tumor margins in association with relapse HCC. Moreover, we identified a novel subpopulation of dendritic cells (PDL1+CD103+ DCs) enriched in the peritumoral area that correlated with early postoperative recurrence, which was further validated in an external cohort. Through the analysis of scRNA-seq data, we found the interaction of PDL1+CD103+ DCs with regulatory T cells and exhausted T cells enhanced immunosuppression and immune escape via multiple ligand-receptor pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
We comprehensively depicted the spatial landscape of single-cell dynamics and multicellular architecture within primary and relapsed HCC. Our findings highlight spatial organization is a prominent determinant of HCC recurrence and provide a valuable insight into the immune evasion mechanisms driving recurrence.">

        <tr id="We adapted a previously developed targeted single-nucleus DNA sequencing (snDNA-seq) method and constructed a new suite of computational analysis tools to study 137,491 single-nucleus DNA libraries from 24 pancreatic cancers collected under a variety of clinical scenarios including early and late diagnoses, different metastatic sites and before- and after-treatment. We refined the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer by capturing events missed by bulk sequencing, and validated the evolution pattern of early fixation of driver single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) followed by generation of intratumoral heterogeneity for copy number variations (CNVs). Intertumoral convergent evolution was common, including subclonal inactivation of TGF-β pathway by mutating various components of it; intratumoral convergence was rarely observed, likely due to strong selective force in pancreatic cancer development. Continuous evolution was frequently seen manifesting as CNVs. In the context of non-targeted treatments, no particular pattern was found across metastases or through treatment. In six pancreatic cancers with germline BRCA2 mutation, we discovered varied timing of biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, which sculpted different evolutionary trajectories and could presumably contribute to differential response to treatment. As the first large-scale application of targeted snDNA-seq on pancreatic cancer, this work provides a sample processing and computational analysis pipeline that warrants further clinical utility.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive mammary neoplasia with a high fatality rate, mainly because of the development of resistance to administered chemotherapy, the standard treatment for this disease. In this study, we employ both bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptional landscape of TNBC cells cultured in two-dimensional monolayers or three-dimensional spheroids, before and after developing resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Our findings reveal significant transcriptional heterogeneity within the TNBC cell populations, with the scRNA-seq identifying rare subsets of cells that express resistance-associated genes not detected by the bulk RNA-seq. Furthermore, we observe a partial shift towards a highly mesenchymal phenotype in chemoresistant cells, suggesting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a prevalent mechanism of resistance in subgroups of these cells. These insights highlight potential therapeutic targets, such as the PDGF signaling pathway mediating EMT, which could be exploited in this setting. Our study underscores the importance of single-cell approaches in understanding tumor heterogeneity and developing more effective, personalized treatment strategies to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC.">

        <tr id="There remains a large need for a greater understanding of the metastatic process within the prostate cancer field. Our research aims to understand the adaptive – ergo potentially metastatic – responses of cancer to changing microenvironments. Emerging evidence has implicated a role of the Polyaneuploid Cancer Cell (PACC) state in metastasis, positing the PACC state as capable of conferring metastatic competency. Mounting in vitro evidence supports increased metastatic potential of cells in the PACC state. Additionally, our recent retrospective study of prostate cancer patients revealed that PACC presence in the prostate at the time of radical prostatectomy was predictive of future metastatic progression. To test for a causative relationship between PACC state biology and metastasis, we leveraged a novel method designed for flow-cytometric detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in subcutaneous, caudal artery, and intracardiac mouse models of metastasis. This approach provides both quantitative and qualitative information about the number and PACC-status of recovered CTCs and DTCs. Collating data from all models, we found that 74% of recovered CTCs and DTCs were in the PACC state. In vivo colonization assays proved PACC populations can regain proliferative capacity at metastatic sites following dormancy. Additional direct and indirect mechanistic in vitro analyses revealed a PACC-specific partial Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition phenotype and a pro-metastatic secretory profile, together providing preliminary evidence that PACCs are mechanistically linked to metastasis. Statement of Significance We provide the first evidence that cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell state contribute to increased metastatic competency in vivo.">

Current methods of unsupervised cell type identification assume a small noise-to-signal ratio of transcriptome measurements that would produce well-separated cell clusters. However, identification of subtypes is obscured by gene expression noise, diminishing the distances in transcriptome space between distinct cell types and blurring boundaries. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion maps to model cellular differentiation as a stochastic process whereby cells settle into local minima, corresponding to cell subtypes, in a potential landscape constructed from transcriptome data using a nearest neighbor graph approach. By applying critical transition fields, we identify individual cells on the verge of transitioning between subtypes, revealing microglial cells in inactivated, homeostatic state before radially transitioning into various specialized subtypes. Specifically, we show that cells from Alzheimer’s disease patients are enriched in a microglia subtype associated to antigen presentation and T-cell recruitment.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have become integral to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, reliable biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy efficacy are limited. Here, we introduce HistoTME, a novel weakly supervised deep learning approach to infer the tumor microenvironment (TME) composition directly from histopathology images of NSCLC patients. We show that HistoTME accurately predicts the expression of 30 distinct cell type-specific molecular signatures directly from whole slide images, achieving an average Pearson correlation of 0.5 with the ground truth on independent tumor cohorts. Furthermore, we find that HistoTME-predicted microenvironment signatures and their underlying interactions improve prognostication of lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy, achieving an AUROC of 0.75[95% CI: 0.61-0.88] for predicting treatment responses following first-line ICI treatment, utilizing an external clinical cohort of 652 patients. Collectively, HistoTME presents an effective approach for interrogating the TME and predicting ICI response, complementing PD-L1 expression, and bringing us closer to personalized immuno-oncology.">

        <tr id="Background Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous disease with adrenergic (ADRN)- and therapy resistant mesenchymal (MES)-like cells driven by distinct transcription factor networks. Here, we investigate the expression of immunotherapeutic targets in each neuroblastoma subtype and propose pan-neuroblastoma and cell state specific targetable cell-surface proteins. Methods We characterized cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples as ADRN-dominant or MES- dominant to define subtype-specific and pan-neuroblastoma gene sets. Targets were validated with ChIP- sequencing, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry in neuroblastoma cell lines and isogenic ADRN-to-MES transition cell line models. Finally, we evaluated the activity of MES-specific agents in vivo and in vitro. Results Most immunotherapeutic targets being developed for neuroblastoma showed significantly higher expression in the ADRN subtype with limited expression in MES-like tumor cells. In contrast, CD276 (B7-H3) and L1CAM maintained expression across both ADRN and MES states. We identified several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) enriched in MES-dominant samples and showed that AXL targeting with ADCT-601 was potently cytotoxic in MES-dominant cell lines and showed specific anti-tumor activity in a MES cell line-derived xenograft. Conclusions Immunotherapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma must address the potential of epigenetic downregulation of antigen density as a mechanism for immune evasion. We identified several RTKs as candidate MES-specific immunotherapeutic target proteins for the elimination of therapy-resistant cells. We hypothesize that the phenomena of immune escape will be less likely when targeting pan-neuroblastoma cell surface proteins such as B7-H3 and L1CAM, and/or dual targeting strategies that consider both the ADRN- and MES-cell states. Key Points Cellular plasticity influences the abundance of immunotherapeutic targets. Subtype-specific targets may be susceptible to epigenetically-mediated downregulation. Immunotherapeutic targets in development, B7-H3 and L1CAM, show “pan-subtype” expression. Importance of Study Neuroblastoma is a lethal childhood malignancy that shows cellular plasticity in response to anti-cancer therapies. Several plasma membrane proteins are being developed as immunotherapeutic targets in this disease. Here we define which cell surface proteins are susceptible to epigenetically regulated downregulation during an adrenergic to mesenchymal cell state switch and propose immunotherapeutic strategies to anticipate and circumvent acquired immunotherapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="Accumulating evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) significantly influences the response to immunotherapy, yet this complex relationship remains elusive. To address this issue, we developed TimiGP-Response (TIME Illustration based on Gene Pairing designed for immunotherapy Response), a computational framework leveraging single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data, along with response information, to construct cell-cell interaction networks associated with responders and estimate the role of immune cells in treatment response. This framework was showcased in triple-negative breast cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction, and orthogonally validated with imaging mass cytometry. As a result, we identified CD8+ GZMB+ T cells associated with responders and its interaction with regulatory T cells emerged as a potential feature for selecting patients who may benefit from these therapies. Subsequently, we analyzed 3,410 patients with seven cancer types (melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, metastatic urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer) treated with various immunotherapies and combination therapies, as well as several chemo- and targeted therapies as controls. Using TimiGP-Response, we depicted the pan-cancer immune landscape associated with immunotherapy response at different resolutions. At the TIME level, CD8 T cells and CD4 memory T cells were associated with responders, while anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages and mast cells were linked to non-responders across most cancer types and datasets. Given that T cells are the primary targets of these immunotherapies and our TIME analysis highlights their importance in response to treatment, we portrayed the pan-caner landscape on 40 T cell subtypes. Notably, CD8+ and CD4+ GZMK+ effector memory T cells emerged as crucial across all cancer types and treatments, while IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells were top candidates associated with immunotherapy non-responders. In summary, this study provides a computational method to study the association between TIME and response across the pan-cancer immune landscape, offering resources and insights into immune cell interactions and their impact on treatment efficacy.">

        <tr id="Interactions between mutant cells and their environment play a key role in determining cancer susceptibility. However, our understanding of how the pre-cancer microenvironment contributes to early tumorigenesis remains limited. Here, we show that newly emerging tumours at their most incipient stages shape their microenvironment in a critical process that determines their survival. Analysis of nascent squamous tumours in the upper gastrointestinal tract of the mouse reveals that the stress response of early tumour cells instructs the underlying mesenchyme to form a supportive “pre-cancer niche”, which dictates the long-term outcome of epithelial lesions. Stimulated fibroblasts beneath emerging tumours activate a wound healing response that triggers a dramatic remodelling of the underlying extracellular matrix, resulting in the formation of a fibronectin-rich stromal scaffold that promotes tumour growth. Functional heterotypic 3D culture assays and in vivo grafting experiments, combining carcinogen-free healthy epithelium and tumour-derived stroma, demonstrate that the pre-cancerous niche alone is sufficient to confer tumour properties to healthy epithelial cells. We propose a model where both mutations and the stromal response to genetic stress defines the likelihood of early tumours to survive and progress towards more advanced disease stages.">

Despite recognizing the essential impact of intratumoral heterogeneity on clinical responses to immunotherapy, our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity in CTA expression has remained limited. We employed single-cell mRNA sequencing to delineate the CTA expression profiles of cancer cells in clinically derived melanoma and lung cancer samples. Our findings reveal a high degree of intratumoral transcriptional heterogeneity in CTA expression. In melanoma, every cell expressed at least one CTA. However, most individual CTAs, including the widely used therapeutic targets NY-ESO-1 and MAGE, were confined to subpopulations of cells and were uncoordinated in their expression, resulting in mosaics of cancer cells with diverse CTA profiles. Coordinated expression was observed, however, mainly among highly structurally and evolutionarily related CTA genes. Importantly, a minor subset of CTAs, including PRAME and several members of the GAGE and MAGE-A families, were homogenously expressed in melanomas, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Extensive heterogeneity in CTA expression was also observed in lung cancer. However, the frequency of CTA-positive cancer cells was notably lower and homogenously expressed CTAs were only identified in one of five tumors in this cancer type. Our findings underscore the need for careful CTA target selection in immunotherapy development and clinical testing and offer a rational framework for identifying the most promising candidates.">

In this environment, cancer cells change their expression profiles to fight against circumstantial stresses, allowing their progression in the challenging tissue space. Technological advancements of spatial omics have had substantial influence on cancer genomics. This technical progress, especially that occurring in the spatial transcriptome, has been drastic and rapid. Here, we describe the latest spatial analytical technologies that have allowed omics feature characterization to retain their spatial and histopathological information in cancer tissues. Several spatial omics platforms have been launched, and the latest platforms finally attained single-cell level or even higher subcellular level resolution. We discuss several key papers elucidating the initial utility of the spatial analysis. In fact, spatial transcriptome analyses reveal comprehensive omics characteristics not only in cancer cells but also their surrounding cells, such as tumor infiltrating immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. We also introduce several spatial omics platforms. We describe our own attempts to investigate molecular events associated with cancer progression. Furthermore, we discuss the next challenges in analyzing the multiomics status of cells, including their morphology and location. These novel technologies, in conjunction with spatial transcriptome analysis and, more importantly, with histopathology, will elucidate even novel key aspects of the intratumor heterogeneity of cancers.

        <tr id="The incidence rate of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which has a poor prognosis, is rapidly increasing. To investigate the intratumor heterogeneity of ICC, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from the primary tumor and adjacent normal tissues of 14 treatment-naïve patients. We identified ten major cell types, along with 45 subclusters of cells. Notably, we identified a fibroblast cluster, Fibroblast_LUM+, which was preferably enriched in tumor tissues and actively interacted with cholangiocytes. LGALS1 was verified as a marker gene of Fibroblast_LUM+, contributing to the malignant phenotype of ICC. The higher amount of LGALS1 + fibroblasts were associated with poorer overall survival in ICC patients. LGALS1 + fibroblasts activated the proliferation and migration of tumor cells by upregulating the expression levels of CCR2, ADAM15, and β-integrin. Silencing LGALS1 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) suppressed CAF-augmented tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro as well as tumor formation in vivo, suggesting that blockade of LGALS1 serves as a potential therapeutic approach for ICC. Taken together, our single-cell analysis provides insight into the interaction between malignant cells and specific subtypes of fibroblasts. Our work will further the understanding of the intratumor heterogeneity of ICC and provide novel strategies for the treatment of ICC by targeting fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.">

The immune response is highly variable during tumor development, and affected by therapies such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Currently, analysis of these local changes is difficult due to poor accessibility of the tumor and high-morbidity of sampling. In this study, we developed a model for repeat-biopsy in mice to study these local immunological changes over time. Using fine needle biopsy we were able to safely and repeatedly collect cells from intracranial tumors in mice. Ultra-fast cycling technology (FAST) was used for multi-cycle immunofluorescence of retrieved cells, and provided insights in the changing immune response over time. The combination of these techniques can be utilized to study changes in the immune response in glioma or other intracranial diseases over time, and in response to treatment within the same animal.

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem of diverse cell types whose interactions govern tumor growth and clinical outcome. While the TME’s impact on immunotherapy has been extensively studied, its role in chemotherapy response remains less explored. To address this, we developed DECODEM (DEcoupling Cell-type-specific Outcomes using DEconvolution and Machine learning), a generic computational framework leveraging cellular deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics to associate the gene expression of individual cell types in the TME with clinical response. Employing DECODEM to analyze the gene expression of breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we find that the gene expression of specific immune cells (myeloid, plasmablasts, B-cells) and stromal cells (endothelial, normal epithelial, CAFs) are highly predictive of chemotherapy response, going beyond that of the malignant cells. These findings are further tested and validated in a single-cell cohort of triple negative breast cancer. To investigate the possible role of immune cell-cell interactions (CCIs) in mediating chemotherapy response, we extended DECODEM to DECODEMi to identify such CCIs, validated in single-cell data. Our findings highlight the importance of active pre-treatment immune infiltration for chemotherapy success. The tools developed here are made publicly available and are applicable for studying the role of the TME in mediating response from readily available bulk tumor expression in a wide range of cancer treatments and indications.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequently occurring cancers, but prognostic biomarkers identifying patients at risk of recurrence are still lacking. In this study, we aimed to investigate in more detail the spatial relationship between intratumoural T cells, cancer cells, and cancer cell hallmarks as prognostic biomarkers in stage III colorectal cancer patients. We conducted multiplexed imaging of 56 protein markers at single-cell resolution on resected fixed tissue from stage III CRC patients who received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy. Images underwent segmentation for tumour, stroma, and immune cells, and cancer cell 'state' protein marker expression was quantified at a cellular level. We developed a Python package for estimation of spatial proximity, nearest neighbour analysis focusing on cancer cell-T-cell interactions at single-cell level. In our discovery cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering samples), we processed 462 core samples (total number of cells: 1,669,228) from 221 adjuvant 5FU-treated stage III patients. The validation cohort (Huntsville Clearview Cancer Center samples) consisted of 272 samples (total number of cells: 853,398) from 98 stage III CRC patients. While there were trends for an association between the percentage of cytotoxic T cells (across the whole cancer core), it did not reach significance (discovery cohort: p = 0.07; validation cohort: p = 0.19). We next utilised our region-based nearest neighbour approach to determine the spatial relationships between cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, and cancer cell clusters. In both cohorts, we found that shorter distance between cytotoxic T cells, T helper cells, and cancer cells was significantly associated with increased disease-free survival. An unsupervised trained model that clustered patients based on the median distance between immune cells and cancer cells, as well as protein expression profiles, successfully classified patients into low-risk and high-risk groups (discovery cohort: p = 0.01; validation cohort: p = 0.003). © 2024 The Author(s).

        <tr id="Simple Summary We utilized publicly available perturbation phosphoproteomic data to construct models elucidating cell state transitions across multiple breast cancer and normal breast tissue-derived cell lines. Employing a hybrid methodology, which integrates machine learning and mechanistic modeling, we separated luminal, basal, and normal cell states and revealed core networks that control cell state transitions. We determined causal connections within the core networks and developed interpretable mechanistic models that elucidated the drivers of cell phenotypes. Significantly, these models can predict synergistic drug combinations capable of potentially reversing oncogenic transformation in breast cancer cell lines. Our methodology will enable designer approaches to identify targeted perturbations that convert cell states and mechanistically underpin therapeutic interventions. Abstract Understanding signaling patterns of transformation and controlling cell phenotypes is a challenge of current biology. Here we applied a cell State Transition Assessment and Regulation (cSTAR) approach to a perturbation dataset of single cell phosphoproteomic patterns of multiple breast cancer (BC) and normal breast tissue-derived cell lines. Following a separation of luminal, basal, and normal cell states, we identified signaling nodes within core control networks, delineated causal connections, and determined the primary drivers underlying oncogenic transformation and transitions across distinct BC subtypes. Whereas cell lines within the same BC subtype have different mutational and expression profiles, the architecture of the core network was similar for all luminal BC cells, and mTOR was a main oncogenic driver. In contrast, core networks of basal BC were heterogeneous and segregated into roughly four major subclasses with distinct oncogenic and BC subtype drivers. Likewise, normal breast tissue cells were separated into two different subclasses. Based on the data and quantified network topologies, we derived mechanistic cSTAR models that serve as digital cell twins and allow the deliberate control of cell movements within a Waddington landscape across different cell states. These cSTAR models suggested strategies of normalizing phosphorylation networks of BC cell lines using small molecule inhibitors.">

These tumors display significant phenotypic plasticity, harboring diverse cell populations ranging from tumor core cells to dispersed, highly invasive cells. Neuron navigator 3 (NAV3), a microtubule-associated protein affecting microtubule growth and dynamics, is downregulated in various cancers, including glioblastoma, and has thus been considered a tumor suppressor. In this study, we challenge this designation and unveil distinct expression patterns of NAV3 across different invasion phenotypes. Using glioblastoma cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem-like cell cultures, we disclose an upregulation of NAV3 in invading glioblastoma cells, contrasting with its lower expression in cells residing in tumor spheroid cores. Furthermore, we establish an association between low and high NAV3 expression and the amoeboid and mesenchymal invasive phenotype, respectively, and demonstrate that overexpression of NAV3 directly stimulates glioblastoma invasive behavior in both 2D and 3D environments. Consistently, we observed increased NAV3 expression in cells migrating along blood vessels in mouse xenografts. Overall, our results shed light on the role of NAV3 in glioblastoma invasion, providing insights into this lethal aspect of glioblastoma behavior.">

T-cell alterations are detectable in asymptomatic myeloma precursor conditions and have the potential to identify precursor patients at imminent risk of progression. However, what myeloma-associated T-cells alterations represent mechanistically, how they relate to tumour burden and gene expression, and what influences high inter-patient variability in immune composition remains unknown. Here, we assembled the largest ever dataset of published and newly-generated single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of the marrow and blood from patients with myeloma, precursor conditions, and age-matched non-cancer controls. We show myeloma is not associated with T-cell exhaustion and instead defined by a pattern of T-cell differentiation resembling antigen-driven terminal memory differentiation. Myeloma-associated T-cell differentiation was dependent on tumour-intrinsic features including tumour burden and tumour expression of antigen-presentation genes. Expanded TCR clones accumulating in myeloma were not enriched for viral specificity and were detected in effector states in highly infiltrated marrows. Together, these results suggest anti-tumour immunity drives a novel form of cancer-associated T-cell memory differentiation in myeloma.">

        <tr id="Durable serological memory following vaccination is critically dependent on the production and survival of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Yet, the factors that control LLPC specification and survival remain poorly resolved. Using intravital two-photon imaging, we find that in contrast to most plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM), LLPCs are uniquely sessile and organized into clusters that are dependent on APRIL, an important survival factor. Using deep, bulk RNA sequencing, and surface protein flow-based phenotyping, we find that LLPCs express a unique transcriptome and phenotype compared to bulk PCs, fine-tuning expression of key cell surface molecules, CD93, CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, and CD48, important for adhesion and homing. Conditional deletion of Cxcr4 in PCs following immunization leads to rapid mobilization from the BM, reduced survival of antigen-specific PCs, and ultimately accelerated decay of antibody titer. In naïve mice, the endogenous LLPCs BCR repertoire exhibits reduced diversity, reduced somatic mutations, and increased public clones and IgM isotypes, particularly in young mice, suggesting LLPC specification is non-random. As mice age, the BM PC compartment becomes enriched in LLPCs, which may outcompete and limit entry of new PCs into the LLPC niche and pool.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes cancer progression. The tumor stroma is characterized by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete factors stimulating tumor growth, invasion, and immunosuppression. Macrophages tend to polarize toward a pro-tumor phenotype. Various other components, including endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural cells, likely contribute to the complexity of the PDAC TME. Epidemiological investigations have highlighted obesity as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, suggesting that adipocytes may also play a significant role. This manuscript offers an overview of the main actors in TME, as well as dysregulated signaling pathways and gene mutations. It underlines how strategies modulating the TME hold promise for improving outcomes. Lastly, it describes how integrating multi-omic approaches may represent a future trajectory to explore novel therapeutic possibilities. Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents significant oncological challenges due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in progression and treatment resistance. Non-neoplastic cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), contribute to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Although immune cells infiltrate TME, tumor cells evade immune responses by secreting chemokines and expressing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Vascular components, like endothelial cells and pericytes, stimulate angiogenesis to support tumor growth, while adipocytes secrete factors that promote cell growth, invasion, and treatment resistance. Additionally, perineural invasion, a characteristic feature of PDAC, contributes to local recurrence and poor prognosis. Moreover, key signaling pathways including Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), Notch, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and Wnt/β-catenin drive tumor progression and resistance. Targeting the TME is crucial for developing effective therapies, including strategies like inhibiting CAFs, modulating immune response, disrupting angiogenesis, and blocking neural cell interactions. A recent multi-omic approach has identified signature genes associated with anoikis resistance, which could serve as prognostic biomarkers and targets for personalized therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Tumor heterogeneity is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance, leading to therapeutic failure. Here, we aim to utilize tumor evolution analysis to decode the intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), unraveling the correlation between tumor heterogeneity and prognosis as well as chemotherapy response through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis. Methods: We collected and curated 28 HGSOC patients single-cell transcriptomic data from five datasets. Then, we developed a novel text mining-based machine learning approach to deconstruct the evolutionary patterns of tumor cell functions. This allowed us to identify key tumor-related genes within different evolutionary branches, elucidate the microenvironmental cell compositions that various functional tumor cells depend on, and analyze the intra- and inter-heterogeneity of tumors and their microenvironments in relation to prognosis and chemotherapy response in HGSOC patients. We further validated our findings in two spatial and seven bulk transcriptomic datasets, totally 1,030 patients. Results: By employing transcriptomic clusters as proxies for functional clonality, we identified a significant increase in tumor cell state heterogeneity, which was strongly correlated with patient prognosis and treatment response. Furthermore, increased intra- and inter-tumoral functional clonality was associated with the characteristics of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). We also found that the spatial proximity between CXCL12-positive CAF and tumor cells, mediated through the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction, is highly positively correlated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in HGSOC. Finally, we constructed a panel of 24 genes through statistical modeling, that are highly correlated with CXCL12-positive fibroblasts and can predict both prognosis and chemotherapy response in HGSOC. Conclusions: Our study offers insights into the collective behavior of tumor cell communities in HGSOC, as well as potential drivers of tumor evolution in response to therapy. Functional analyses and experiments revealed a strong association between CXCL12-positive fibroblasts and tumor progression as well as treatment outcomes. Our findings provide an important theoretical basis for clinical HGSOC treatment.">

        <tr id="Achieving long-term disease control using therapeutic immunomodulation is a long-standing concept with a strong tradition in blood malignancies. Besides allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that continues to provide potentially curative treatment for otherwise challenging diagnoses, recent years have seen impressive progress in immunotherapies for leukemias and lymphomas with immune checkpoint blockade, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and CAR T cell therapies. Despite their success, non-response, relapse, and immune toxicities remain frequent, thus prioritizing the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and identifying predictive biomarkers. The increasing availability of single-cell genomic tools now provides a system’s immunology view to resolve the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immunotherapies at unprecedented resolution. Here, we review recent studies that leverage these technological advancements for tracking immune responses, the emergence of immune resistance, and toxicities. As single-cell immune monitoring tools evolve and become more accessible, we expect their wide adoption for routine clinical applications to catalyze more precise therapeutic steering of personal immune responses.">

        <tr id="Effective cancer immunotherapy relies on the clonal proliferation and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the tumor1,2. However, our insights into clonal expansions are limited, owing to an inability to track the same clones in tumors over time. Here, we developed a multi-tumor mouse model system to track hundreds of expanding and contracting CD8+ T cell clones over multiple timepoints in tumors of the same individual. Through coupling of clonal expansion dynamics and single-cell RNA/TCR-seq data, we identified a transcriptomic signature in PD-1+Ly108+ precursor exhausted cells3,4 that strongly predicts rates of intratumoral clone expansion in mice and humans. We found that expression of the signature successfully stratifies melanoma patient outcomes to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade5,6. Downregulation of the signature precedes clone contraction – a phase in which clones contract but maintain revivable precursor exhausted cells in the tumor. LAG-3 blockade – an FDA-approved therapy whose effects on CD8+ T cell responses are currently unclear7, re-activates the expansion signature, re-expanding pre-existing clones, including previously contracted clones. These findings reveal how the study of clonal expansion dynamics provide a powerful ‘pan-immunotherapy’ signature for monitoring immunotherapies, including PD-1/PD-L1 and LAG-3 blockade, with implications for their future development.">

Tracking these phenotypes in living cells can provide insight into immune function, but remains a challenging pursuit.

We aimed to fill this void using bioluminescent technologies. Here we report genetically engineered luciferase reporters for long-term monitoring of macrophage polarization via spectral phasor analysis. M1- and M2-specific promoters were used to drive the expression of bioluminescent enzymes in macrophage cell lines. The readouts were multiplexed and discernable in both 2D and 3D formats with single cell resolution in living samples.

        <tr id="Abstract Melanoma, a highly malignant tumour, presents significant challenges due to its cellular heterogeneity, yet research on this aspect in cutaneous melanoma remains limited. In this study, we utilized single‐cell data from 92,521 cells to explore the tumour cell landscape. Through clustering analysis, we identified six distinct cell clusters and investigated their differentiation and metabolic heterogeneity using multi‐omics approaches. Notably, cytotrace analysis and pseudotime trajectories revealed distinct stages of tumour cell differentiation, which have implications for patient survival. By leveraging markers from these clusters, we developed a tumour cell‐specific machine learning model (TCM). This model not only predicts patient outcomes and responses to immunotherapy, but also distinguishes between genomically stable and unstable tumours and identifies inflamed (‘hot’) versus non‐inflamed (‘cold’) tumours. Intriguingly, the TCM score showed a strong association with TOMM40, which we experimentally validated as an oncogene promoting tumour proliferation, invasion and migration. Overall, our findings introduce a novel biomarker score that aids in selecting melanoma patients for improved prognoses and targeted immunotherapy, thereby guiding clinical treatment decisions.">

        <tr id="The biology centered around the TGF-β type I receptor ALK1 (encoded by ACVRL1) has been almost exclusively based on its reported endothelial expression pattern since its first functional characterization more than two decades ago. Here, in efforts to better define the therapeutic context in which to use ALK1 inhibitors, we uncover a population of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that, by virtue of their unanticipated Acvrl1 expression, are effector targets for adjuvant anti-angiogenic immunotherapy in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer. The combinatorial benefit depended on ALK1-mediated modulation of the differentiation potential of bone marrow-derived granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, the release of CD14+ monocytes into circulation, and their eventual extravasation. Notably, ACVRL1+ TAMs coincided with an immunosuppressive phenotype, and were over-represented in human cancers progressing on therapy. Accordingly, breast cancer patients with a prominent ACVRL1hi TAM signature exhibited a significantly shorter survival. In conclusion, we shed light on an unexpected multimodal regulation of tumorigenic phenotypes by ALK1 and demonstrate its utility as a target for anti-angiogenic immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Tumoroids, also known as cancer organoids, are patient-derived cancer cells grown as 3D, self-organized multicellular structures that maintain key characteristics (e.g., genotype, gene expression levels) of the tumor from which they originated. These models have emerged as valuable tools for studying tumor biology, cytotoxicity, and response of patient-derived cells to cancer therapies. However, the establishment and maintenance of tumoroids has historically been challenging, labor intensive, and highly variable from lab to lab, hindering their widespread use. Here, we characterize the establishment and/or expansion of colorectal, lung, head and neck, breast, pancreas, and endometrial tumoroids using the standardized, serum-free Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium. Newly derived tumoroid lines (n=20) were analyzed by targeted genomic profiling and RNA sequencing and were representative of tumor tissue samples. Tumoroid lines were stable for over 250 days in culture and freeze-thaw competent. Previously established tumoroid lines were also transitioned to OncoPro medium and exhibited, on average, similar growth rates and conserved donor-specific characteristics when compared to original media systems. Additionally, OncoPro medium was compatible with both embedded culture in extracellular matrix and growth in a suspension format for facile culture and scale up. An example application of these models for assessing the cytotoxicity of a natural killer cell line and primary natural killer cells over time and at various doses demonstrated the compatibility of these models with assays used in compound and cell therapy development. We anticipate that the standardization and versatility of this approach will have important benefits for basic cancer research, drug discovery, and personalized medicine and help make tumoroid models more accessible to the cancer research community.">

        <tr id="Background: Cancer initiation, progression, and immune evasion depend on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, understanding the TME immune architecture is essential for understanding tumor metastasis and therapy response. This study aimed to create an immune cell states (CSs) atlas using bulk RNA-seq data enriched by eco-type analyses to resolve the complex immune architectures in the TME. Methods: We employed EcoTyper, a machine-learning (ML) framework, to study the real-world prognostic significance of immune CSs and multicellular ecosystems, utilizing molecular data from 1,610 patients with multiple malignancies who underwent immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy within the ORIEN Avatar cohort, a well-annotated real-world dataset. Results: Our analysis revealed consistent ICI-specific prognostic TME carcinoma ecotypes (CEs) (including CE1, CE9, CE10) across our pan-cancer dataset, where CE1 being more lymphocyte-deficient and CE10 being more proinflammatory. Also, the analysis of specific immune CSs across different cancers showed consistent CD8+ and CD4+ T cell CS distribution patterns. Furthermore, survival analysis of the ORIEN ICI cohort demonstrated that ecotype CE9 is associated with the most favorable survival outcomes, while CE2 is linked to the least favorable outcomes. Notably, the melanoma-specific prognostic EcoTyper model confirmed that lower predicted risk scores are associated with improved survival and better response to immunotherapy. Finally, de novo discovery of ecotypes in the ORIEN ICI dataset identified Ecotype E3 as significantly associated with poorer survival outcomes. Conclusion: Our findings offer important insights into refining the patient selection process for immunotherapy in real-world practice and guiding the creation of novel therapeutic strategies to target specific ecotypes within the TME.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are an integral part of the innate immune system, but their biology is not well understood in the context of cancer. Distinctive resident macrophage populations are identified in different organs in mice using fate mapping studies. They develop from the yolk sac and self-maintain themselves lifelong in specific tissular niches. Similarly, breast-resident macrophages are part of the mammary gland microenvironment. They reside in the breast adipose tissue stroma and close to the ductal epithelium and help in morphogenesis. In breast cancer, TRMs may promote disease progression and metastasis; however, precise mechanisms have not been elucidated. TRMs interact intimately with recruited macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cells along with cancer cells, deciding further immunosuppressive or cytotoxic pathways. Moreover, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is generally associated with poor outcomes, can harbor specific TRM phenotypes. The influence of TRMs on adipose tissue stroma of the mammary gland also contributes to tumor progression. The complex crosstalk between TRMs with T cells, stroma, and breast cancer cells can establish a cascade of downstream events, understanding which can offer new insight for drug discovery and upcoming treatment choices. This review aims to acknowledge the previous research done in this regard while exploring existing research gaps and the future therapeutic potential of TRMs as a combination or single agent in breast cancer.">

 Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that exhibits clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity. While generally thought to be incurable, recently demonstrated clinical activity of both chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and bispecific antibodies suggest that immune-mediated therapies offer substantial benefit in this disease and underscores the value of understanding mechanisms of immune evasion in this disease.
 Aim: The aim of this project is to uncover distinct cellular networks driving immune evasion in MCL across disease sites.
 Methods: We analyzed 10 archival samples collected from 8 clinically annotated patients with untreated MCL, including mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes (LN) and bone marrow (BM). After generating single-cell suspensions from tumors, we performed Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq) and identified malignant B cells based on the co-expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and B cell markers (MS4A1, CD79A, CD79B). B and T cells were then subclustered using a reference mapping geneset. Molecular signatures database was utilized to perform geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA).
 Results: Our study first confirms the heterogeneity of mantle cell lymphoma across compartments (i.e PB, LN, BM), showing 5 different clusters of malignant cells, with different abundance in cell proportion among patients. We found that malignant B cells expressed different levels of CCND1 expression across tissue compartments. Furthermore, we identified a specific cluster of malignant cells, enriched in the PB, marked by decreased expression of the costimulatory receptor CD40 and higher levels of B-cell receptor signaling. This may explain the rapid response of circulating MCL cells to Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibition. Interestingly, the higher expression of CD40 on LN-resident MCL cells suggests that MCL cells may co-opt LN-resident T-cells to support their growth, as has been previously described. Consistent with this, T-cells from LN were phenotypically exhausted, suggesting that MCL cells within the LN leverage local interactions with T-cells to promote survival while avoiding T-cell-driven cytotoxicity. Finally, we also found that high level of Ki67 correlates with myeloid-cell abundance in the TME suggesting that monocytes may support tumor cell proliferation.
 Conclusion: These results provide a deeper understanding of tissue-specific heterogeneity in MCL, including distinct tumor-immune interactions at different tissue sites. In ongoing analyses, we will correlate these findings with patient outcomes and response to BTK inhibition and are currently analyzing samples from patients with relapsed disease to identify microenvironmental features associated with disease progression.

        <tr id="In vitro models coupled with multimodal approaches are needed to dissect the dynamic response of local tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to immunotherapy. Here the patient-derived primary lung cancer organoids (pLCOs) are generated by isolating tumor cell clusters, including the infiltrated immune cells. A function-associated single-cell RNA sequencing (FascRNA-seq) platform allowing both phenotypic evaluation and scRNA-seq at single-organoid level is developed to dissect the TIME of individual pLCOs. The analysis of 171 individual pLCOs derived from seven patients reveals that pLCOs retain the TIME heterogeneity in the parenchyma of parental tumor tissues, providing models with identical genetic background but various TIME. Linking the scRNA-seq data of individual pLCOs with their responses to anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) allows to confirm the central role of CD8+ T cells in anti-tumor immunity, to identify potential tumor-reactive T cells with a set of 10 genes, and to unravel the factors regulating T cell activity, including CD99 gene. In summary, the study constructs a joint phenotypic and transcriptomic FascRNA-seq platform to dissect the dynamic response of local TIME under ICB treatment, providing a promising approach to evaluate novel immunotherapies and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.">

        <tr id="The observation that certain therapeutic strategies for targeting inflammation benefit patients with distinct immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) is exemplified by the success of TNF blockade in conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and skin psoriasis, albeit only for subsets of individuals with each condition. This suggests intersecting “nodes” in inflammatory networks at a molecular and cellular level may drive and/or maintain IMIDs, being “shared” between traditionally distinct diagnoses without mapping neatly to a single clinical phenotype. In line with this proposition, integrative tumour tissue analyses in oncology have highlighted novel cell states acting across diverse cancers, with important implications for precision medicine. Drawing upon advances in the oncology field, this narrative review will first summarise learnings from the Human Cell Atlas in health as a platform for interrogating IMID tissues. It will then review cross-disease studies to date that inform this endeavour before considering future directions in the field.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune checkpoint (IC) blockade and adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T-cells (ACT) are two major strategies to treat metastatic melanoma. Their combination can potentiate T-cell activation in the suppressive tumor microenvironment, but the autoimmune adverse effects associated with systemic injection of IC blockers persist with this strategy. ACT of tumor-reactive T-cells defective for IC expression would overcome this issue. For this purpose, PD-1 and TIGIT appear to be relevant candidates, because their co-expression on highly tumor-reactive lymphocytes limits their therapeutic efficacy within the tumor microenvironme,nt. Our study compares the consequences of PDCD1 or TIGIT genetic deletion on anti-tumor properties and T-cell fitness of melanoma-specific T lymphocytes. Transcriptomic analyses revealed down-regulation of cell cycle-related genes in PD-1KO T-cells, consistent with biological observations, whereas proliferative pathways were preserved in TIGITKO T-cells. Functional analyses showed that PD-1KO and TIGITKO T-cells displayed superior antitumor reactivity than their wild-type counterpart in vitro and in a preclinical melanoma model using immunodeficient mice. Interestingly, it appears that TIGITKO T-cells were more effective at inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vivo, and persist longer within tumors than PD-1KO T-cells, consistent with the absence of impact of TIGIT deletion on T-cell fitness. Taken together, these results suggest that TIGIT deletion, over PD-1 deletion, in melanoma-specific T-cells is a compelling option for future immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a widely used method for classifying cell types and states and revealing disease mechanisms. However, most contemporary scRNA-seq platforms fail to explore the multi-landscape of RNA. Here, we designed a microfluidic chip combined oligo-dT primers and Random Bridging Co-labeling (RBCL) RNA sequencing to develop an innovative Chigene scRNA-seq technology that can identify gene expression, mutations, and RNA splicing landscapes at the single-cell level. The Chigene scRNA-seq platform demonstrated exceptional performance, with minimal doublet rates of 0.94% (Chigene V1) and 1.93% (Chigene V2). Both versions exhibit high sensitivity, with Chigene V2 achieving nearly 100% RNA coverage and detecting over 1800 genes per cell on average. Targeted capture of single-cell gene mutations enhances mutation detection sensitivity. Moreover, this Chigene V2 platform has been validated in clinical samples for its ability to detect mutations, gene fusions and alternative splicing. The reliability of the platform was further corroborated using known functional gene mutation (CDKN1A) and fusion (FGFR3-TACC). To validate this method’s potential for discovering novel gene mutations in clinical samples, our investigation revealed an intriguing cell subpopulation carrying an ARHGAP5 mutation in urothelial carcinoma. These cells exhibited high-frequency mRNA splicing and exhibited specific crosstalk with T cells, distinguishing them from the subpopulation with the ARHGAP5 wild-type phenotype. Overall, this method provides a robust scRNA-seq platform suitable for comprehensive analyses of clinical specimens at different genetic information levels, thereby offering significant potential in the discovery of novel genes and interactions at the single-cell level.">

        <tr id="Background Glycosyltransferase-associated genes play a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. This study investigates their impact on the tumor microenvironment and molecular mechanisms, offering insights into innovative immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC. Methods We utilized cutting-edge single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to examine HCC heterogeneity. Four single-cell scoring techniques were employed to evaluate glycosyltransferase genes. Spatial transcriptomic findings were validated, and bulk RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify prognostic glycosyltransferase-related genes and potential immunotherapeutic targets. MGAT1’s role was further explored through various functional assays. Results Our analysis revealed diverse cell subpopulations in HCC with distinct glycosyltransferase gene activities, particularly in macrophages. Key glycosyltransferase genes specific to macrophages were identified. Temporal analysis illustrated macrophage evolution during tumor progression, while spatial transcriptomics highlighted reduced expression of these genes in core tumor macrophages. Integrating scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics, MGAT1 emerged as a promising therapeutic target, showing significant potential in HCC immunotherapy. Conclusion This comprehensive study delves into glycosyltransferase-associated genes in HCC, elucidating their critical roles in cellular dynamics and immune cell interactions. Our findings open new avenues for immunotherapeutic interventions and personalized HCC management, pushing the boundaries of HCC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cancers are commonly characterised by a complex pathology encompassing genetic, microscopic and macroscopic features, which can be probed individually using imaging and omics technologies. Integrating this data to obtain a full understanding of pathology remains challenging. We introduce a new method called Deep Latent Variable Path Modelling (DLVPM), which combines the representational power of deep learning with the capacity of path modelling to identify relationships between interacting elements in a complex system. To evaluate the capabilities of DLVPM, we initially trained a foundational model to map dependencies between SNV, Methylation, miRNA-Seq, RNA-Seq and Histological data using Breast Cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This method exhibited superior performance in mapping associations between data types compared to classical path modelling. We additionally performed successful applications of the model to: stratify single-cell data, identify synthetic lethal interactions using CRISPR-Cas9 screens derived from cell-lines, and detect histologic-transcriptional associations using spatial transcriptomic data. Results from each of these data types can then be understood with reference to the same holistic model of illness.">

        <tr id="Pericytes, recognized as mural cells, have long been described as components involved in blood vessel formation, playing a mere supporting role for endothelial cells (ECs). Emerging evidence strongly suggests their multifaceted roles in tissues and organs. Indeed, pericytes exhibit a remarkable ability to anticipate endothelial cell behavior and adapt their functions based on the specific cells they interact with. Pericytes can be activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli and crosstalk with immune cells, actively participating in their transmigration into blood vessels. Moreover, they can influence the immune response, often sustaining an immunosuppressive phenotype in most of the cancer types studied. In this review, we concentrate on the intricate crosstalk between pericytes and immune cells in cancer, highlighting the primary evidence regarding pericyte involvement in primary tumor mass dynamics, their contributions to tumor reprogramming for invasion and migration of malignant cells, and their role in the formation of pre-metastatic niches. Finally, we explored recent and emerging pharmacological approaches aimed at vascular normalization, including novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy through combined use with anti-angiogenic drugs.">

        <tr id="Our research aimed to identify new therapeutic targets for Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a major subtype of non-small cell lung cancer known for its low 5-year survival rate of 22%. By employing a comprehensive methodological approach, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing data from 513 LUAD and 59 non-tumorous tissues, identifying 2,688 differentially expressed genes. Using Mendelian randomization (MR), we identified 74 genes with strong evidence for a causal effect on risk of LUAD. Survival analysis on these genes revealed significant differences in survival rates for 13 of them. Our pathway enrichment analysis highlighted their roles in immune response and cell communication, deepening our understanding. We also utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to uncover cell type-specific gene expression patterns within LUAD, emphasizing the tumor microenvironment’s heterogeneity. Pseudotime analysis further assisted in assessing the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential druggability of these identified genes. The culmination of our efforts led to the identification of five genes (tier 1) with the most compelling evidence, including SECISBP2L, PRCD, SMAD9, C2orf91, and HSD17B13, and eight genes (tier 2) with convincing evidence for their potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Glioblastomas are known for their poor clinical prognosis, with recurrent tumors often exhibiting greater invasiveness and faster growth rates compared to primary tumors. To understand the intratumoral changes driving this phenomenon, we employed single-cell sequencing to analyze the differences between two pairs of primary and recurrent glioblastomas. Our findings revealed an upregulation of ferroptosis in endothelial cells within recurrent tumors, identified by the significant overexpression of the NOX4 gene. Further analysis indicated that knocking down NOX4 in endothelial cells reduced the activity of the ferroptosis pathway. Utilizing conditioned media from endothelial cells with lower ferroptosis activity, we observed a decrease in the growth rate of glioblastoma cells. These results highlighted the complex role of ferroptosis within tumors and suggested that targeting ferroptosis in the treatment of glioblastomas requires careful consideration of its effects on endothelial cells, as it may otherwise produce counterproductive outcomes.">

        <tr id="Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly studied for its diverse applications in non-invasive detection. Non-randomly cleaved by nucleases and released into the bloodstream, cfDNA exhibits a variety of intrinsic fragmentation patterns indicative of cell status. Particularly, these fragmentation patterns have recently been demonstrated to be effective in predicting cancer and its tissue-of-origin, owing to increased variation of fragmentation features observed in tumor patients. However, there remains a lack of detailed exploration of altered cfDNA fragmentation profiles in tumors, which consist of a mixture of both ambient cfDNA and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Hence, we leveraged the human tumor cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) mouse model, where different tumor cell lines were implanted into different anatomical sites, to isolate pure ctDNA and separately investigate the fragment properties of ambient cfDNA and ctDNA. We found an enrichment of short cfDNA fragments in both ambient cfDNA and ctDNA compared to normal plasma cfDNA, with more elevated short fragments in ctDNA. Moreover, the ambient cfDNA fragmentation features distinguished between CDX models of different cell lines, while the ctDNA fragmentation features conversely discriminate between CDX models of different anatomical sites. The results suggested that both ambient cfDNA and ctDNA contribute to the increased variation observed in tumors, and that cfDNA fragmentation may be highly variable and susceptible to regulations by both original cells and cells within the local niche.">

        <tr id="The spatial composition and cellular heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. High-definition pathology imaging of tumor biopsies provide a high-resolution view of the spatial organization of different types of cells. This allows for systematic assessment of intra- and inter-patient spatial cellular interactions and heterogeneity by integrating accompanying patient-level genomics data. However, joint modeling across tumor biopsies presents unique challenges due to non-conformability (lack of a common spatial domain across biopsies) as well as high-dimensionality. To address this problem, we propose the Dual random effect and main effect selection model for Spatially structured regression model (DreameSpase). DreameSpase employs a Bayesian variable selection framework that facilitates the assessment of spatial heterogeneity with respect to covariates both within (through fixed effects) and between spaces (through spatial random effects) for non-conformable spatial domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DreameSpase via simulations and integrative analyses of pathology imaging and gene expression data obtained from $335$ melanoma biopsies. Our findings confirm several existing relationships, e.g. neutrophil genes being associated with both inter- and intra-patient spatial heterogeneity, as well as discovering novel associations. We also provide freely available and computationally efficient software for implementing DreameSpase.">

What’s more advantageous to the field is if such subsets can be a target of immunotherapy. Here we analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of patients with triple-negative breast cancer and identified APOE or FABP5-expressing macrophages correlated with poor prognosis. Further validation with TCGA-BRCA cohort detailed molecular signatures of these macrophages as lipidic and senescent. Our receptor-ligand mapping identified lipidic and senescent macrophages both suppress T-lymphoid and myeloid immunogenicity. Finally, we discovered that immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy reprogrammed anti-tumor microenvironment enriched with FOLR2+ macrophages facilitated T-cell activations. This suggests that lipidic and senescent macrophages could be a therapeutic target of immune checkpoint therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Carotid atherosclerosis is orchestrated by cell-cell communication that drives progression along a clinical continuum (asymptomatic to symptomatic). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived nanoparticles representing a new paradigm in cellular communication. Little is known about their biological cargo, cellular origin/destination, and functional roles in human atherosclerotic plaque. Methods: EVs were enriched via size exclusion chromatography from human carotid endarterectomy samples dissected into paired plaque and marginal zones (symptomatic n=16, asymptomatic n=13). EV cargos were assessed via whole transcriptome miRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. EV multi-omics were integrated with bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to predict EV cellular origin and ligand-receptor interactions, and multi-modal biological network integration of EV-cargo was completed. EV functional impact was assessed with endothelial angiogenesis assays. Results: Carotid plaques contained more EVs than adjacent marginal zones, with differential enrichment for EV-miRNAs and EV-proteins in key atherogenic pathways. EV cellular origin analysis suggested that tissue EV signatures originated from endothelial cells (EC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), and immune cells. Integrated tissue vesiculomics and scRNA-seq indicated complex EV-vascular cell communication that changed with disease progression and plaque vulnerability (i.e., symptomatic disease). Plaques from symptomatic patients, but not asymptomatic patients, were characterized by increased involvement of endothelial pathways and more complex ligand-receptor interactions, relative to their marginal zones. Plaque-EVs were predicted to mediate communication with ECs. Pathway enrichment analysis delineated an endothelial signature with roles in angiogenesis and neovascularization – well-known indices of plaque instability. This was validated functionally, wherein human carotid symptomatic plaque EVs induced sprouting angiogenesis in comparison to their matched marginal zones. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that EVs may drive dynamic changes in plaques through EV- vascular cell communication and effector functions that typify vulnerability to rupture, precipitating symptomatic disease. The discovery of endothelial-directed angiogenic processes mediated by EVs creates new therapeutic avenues for atherosclerosis.">

        <tr id="Melanoma showcases a complex interplay of genetic alterations and intra- and inter-cellular morphological changes during metastatic transformation. While pivotal, the role of specific mutations in dictating these changes still needs to be fully elucidated. Telomerase promoter mutations (TERTp mutations) significantly influence melanoma’s progression, invasiveness, and resistance to various emerging treatments, including chemical inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, targeted therapy, and immunotherapies. We aim to understand the morphological and phenotypic implications of the two dominant monoallelic TERTp mutations, C228T and C250T, enriched in melanoma metastasis. We developed isogenic clonal cell lines containing the TERTp mutations and utilized dual-color expression reporters steered by the endogenous Telomerase promoter, giving us allelic resolution. This approach allowed us to monitor morpholomic variations induced by these mutations. TERTp mutation-bearing cells exhibited significant morpholome differences from their wild-type counterparts, with increased allele expression patterns, augmented wound-healing rates, and unique spatiotemporal dynamics. Notably, the C250T mutation exerted more pronounced changes in the morpholome than C228T, suggesting a differential role in metastatic potential. Our findings underscore the distinct influence of TERTp mutations on melanoma’s cellular architecture and behavior. The C250T mutation may offer a unique morpholomic and systems-driven advantage for metastasis. These insights provide a foundational understanding of how a non-coding mutation in melanoma metastasis affects the system, manifesting in cellular morpholome.">

        <tr id="Macrophages represent an immune cell population characterized by high plasticity and a range of properties and functions. Their activation status and specific phenotype are highly associated with their localization and the environmental cues they receive. The roles of macrophages in cancer development are diverse. Despite their antitumor effects at early stages of the disease, their presence in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been linked to tumor promotion upon disease establishment. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are key components of breast cancer TME and they have been associated with poor clinical outcomes. High TAM densities were found to correlate with tumor progression, increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Interestingly, considerably higher levels of TAMs were found in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)—the most aggressive type of breast cancer—compared to other types. The present review summarizes recent findings regarding the distinct TAM subsets in the TME and TAM involvement in breast cancer progression and metastasis. It highlights the constant interplay between TAMs and breast cancer cells and its major contribution to the progression of the disease, including such aspects as, polarization of macrophages toward a tumor promoting phenotype, induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells and enhancement of cancer stem cell properties. Further, we discuss the clinical relevance of these findings, focusing on how a better delineation of TAM involvement in breast cancer metastasis will facilitate the selection of more efficient treatment options.">

        <tr id="Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a highly aggressive cancer predominantly occurring in male adolescents and young adults. The lack of a comprehensive understanding on the biology of the disease is paralleled by its dismal survival rates (5–20%). To overcome this challenge, we first identified and prioritized urgently needed resources for clinicians and researchers. Thus, we established genome-wide single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk proteomic data of in vitro and in vivo-generated knockdown models of the pathognomonic DSRCT fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::WT1) and combined them with an original systems-biology-based pipeline including patient data and the largest histology collection of DSRCTs and morphological mimics available to date. These novel tools were enriched with curated public datasets including patient- and cell line-derived ChIP-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies resulting in a multi-model and multi-omic toolbox for discovery analyses. As a proof of concept, our approach revealed the alpha-2/delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, CACNA2D2, as a highly overexpressed, super-enhancer driven, direct target of EWSR1::WT1. Single-cell and bulk-level analyses of patient samples and xenografted cell lines highlighted CACNA2D2 as a critical component of our newly established EWSR1::WT1 oncogenic signature, that can be employed to robustly identify DSRCT in reference sets. Finally, we show that CACNA2D2 is a highly sensitive and specific single biomarker for fast, simple, and cost-efficient diagnosis of DSRCT. Collectively, we establish a large-scale multi-omics dataset for this devastating disease and provide a blueprint of how such toolbox can be used to identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic markers, which may significantly reduce misdiagnoses, and thus improve patient care.">

Although recent studies have derived RNAseq-based signatures, there remains a need for a reproducible and cost-effective method to measure the pathway activation. In recent years, deep learning applied to histology slides have emerged as an effective way to predict molecular information from a data modality available in clinical routine.

        <tr id="Introduction Glioma, a prevalent and deadly brain tumor, is marked by significant cellular heterogeneity and metabolic alterations. However, the comprehensive cell-of-origin and metabolic landscape in high-grade (Glioblastoma Multiforme, WHO grade IV) and low-grade (Oligoastrocytoma, WHO grade II) gliomas remains elusive. Methods In this study, we undertook single-cell transcriptome sequencing of these glioma grades to elucidate their cellular and metabolic distinctions. Following the identification of cell types, we compared metabolic pathway activities and gene expressions between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. Results Notably, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) exhibited the most substantial differences in both metabolic pathways and gene expression, indicative of their distinct origins. The comprehensive analysis identified the most altered metabolic pathways (MCPs) and genes across all cell types, which were further validated against TCGA and CGGA datasets for clinical relevance. Discussion Crucially, the metabolic enzyme phosphodiesterase 8B (PDE8B) was found to be exclusively expressed and progressively downregulated in astrocytes and OPCs in higher-grade gliomas. This decreased expression identifies PDE8B as a metabolism-related oncogene in IDH-mutant glioma, marking its dual role as both a protective marker for glioma grading and prognosis and as a facilitator in glioma progression.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Kidney allograft rejections are orchestrated by a variety of immune cells. Because of the complex histopathologic features, accurate pathological diagnosis poses challenges even for expert pathologists. The objective of this study was to unveil novel spatial indices associated with transplant rejection by using a spatial bioinformatic approach using 36-plex immunofluorescence image data.


METHODS
The image obtained from 11 T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and 12 antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) samples were segmented into 753 737 single cells using DeepCell's Mesmer algorithm. These cells were categorized into 13 distinct cell types through unsupervised clustering based on their biomarker expression profiles. Cell neighborhood analysis allowed us to stratify kidney tissue into 8 distinct neighborhood components consisting of unique cell type enrichment profiles.


RESULTS
In contrast to TCMR samples, AMR samples exhibited a higher frequency of neighborhood components that were characterized by an enrichment of CD31+ endothelial cells. Although the overall frequency of CD68+ macrophages in AMR samples was not significantly high, CD68+ macrophages within endothelial cell-rich lesions exhibited a significantly higher frequency in AMR samples than TCMR samples. Furthermore, the frequency of interactions between CD31+ cells and CD68+ cells was significantly increased in AMR samples, implying the pivotal role of macrophages in AMR pathogenesis. Importantly, patients demonstrating a high frequency of CD31:CD68 interactions experienced significantly poorer outcomes in terms of chronic AMR progression.


CONCLUSIONS
Collectively, these data indicate the potential of spatial bioinformatic as a valuable tool for aiding in pathological diagnosis and for uncovering new insights into the mechanisms underlying transplant rejection.">

        <tr id="Development of subtype heterogeneity in breast cancer requires stochastic transitions between cell types. Here, we sought to characterize how NF-κB contributes to breast cancer progression. We built a gene regulatory network model and calibrated it to the expression levels of NF-κB, TWIST1, SIP1, and SLUG in HER2+ and TNBC cell line, using patient and in vitro published data for validation. The model’s epigenetic landscape exhibits two attractor basins separated by a fluctuation-susceptible slow route. NF-κB stochastic fluctuations induce irreversible transitions from HER2+ to TNBC basins at different times, increasing heterogeneity. Mutations altering the availability of NF-κB change the size of the subtype basins, changing the transition probabilities. Our findings enhance the established attractor landscape formulation and deepen understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BCa) is a major global health challenge, characterized by chromosomal instability (CIN) and subsequent acquisition of extensive somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). CNAs including amplifications and deletions, significantly influence intra-tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Among these, the loss of chromosome 13q14.2 emerges as a considerable factor in BCa pathogenesis and treatment responses. We provide evidence that this genomic alteration is under positive selective pressure, correlating with poorer patient survival. Furthermore, through multi-omic and in vitro analyses, we uncover a dual role of 13q14.2 loss: it confers a survival advantage to tumor cells and modulate the cell cycle and pro-apoptotic pathways in cancer cells, affecting macrophages population in the TME, while paradoxically increasing tumor susceptibility to BCL2 inhibitors. These findings suggest that targeting 13q14.2 as a biomarker in BCa could enhance the efficacy of existing treatments and offer a new avenue for improving clinical outcomes in BCa. Figure 1.

        <tr id="RNA-Seq on primary p53/MCA sarcomas and transplant p53/MCA sarcomas (12). CIBERSORTx analysis of the gene expression data from the 2 different murine tumor models was compared with human UPS samples from TCGA, and primary p53/MCA tumors resembled the less-inflamed sarcomas in patients with low immune infiltration and had a worse correlation with overall survival (12, 43). In contrast, untreated transplant p53/ MCA tumors resembled highly inflamed human sarcomas with high levels of immune infiltrate and are associated with improved overall survival (12, 43). Our results demonstrate an enhanced radiation response of primary sarcomas treated with intratumoral CpG as measured by tumor growth delay, which is mediated through the activation and expansion of intratumoral CD8 + T cells. Our work suggests that the combination of RT with a TLR9 agonist, such as CpG, warrants evaluation in a clinical trial of sarcomas and perhaps other cancers. Mechanistically, our work indicates that combination treatment with CpG and RT enhances the activation and proliferation of intratumoral CD8 + T cells, as demonstrated by CyTOF, IHC, scRNA-Seq, and bulk tumor RNA-Seq. These CD8 + T cells express high levels of granzymes and IFN-γ , indicating that they are activated and capable of cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the majority of these T cells are also in the S or G2-M phases of the cell cycle, demonstrating active proliferation. The TCR clonality analysis further supports targeted tumor-antigen–specific T cell response rather than a general proliferation of T cells.

        <tr id="Abstract Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is often considered one of the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, characterized by a high recurrence rate and low overall survival (OS). It is notorious for posing challenges related to drug resistance. While there has been progress in TNBC research, the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance in TNBC remain largely elusive. We collect single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) data from five TNBC patients susceptible to chemotherapy and five resistant cases. Comprehensive analyses involving copy number variation (CNV), pseudotime trajectory, cell–cell interactions, pseudospace analysis, as well as transcription factor and functional enrichment are conducted specifically on macrophages and malignant cells. Furthermore, we performed validation experiments on clinical samples using multiplex immunofluorescence. We identified a subset of SPP1+ macrophages that secrete SPP1 signals interacting with CD44 on malignant cell surfaces, potentially activating the PDE3B pathway within malignant cells via the integrin pathway, leading to chemotherapy resistance. The abnormally enhanced SPP1 signal between macrophages and malignant cells may serve as a factor promoting chemotherapy resistance in TNBC patients. Therefore, SPP1+ macrophages could potentially serve as a therapeutic target to reduce chemotherapy resistance.">

Here, we identify T helper 17 (TH17) cell plasticity in the kidneys of patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated glomerulonephritis on the basis of single-cell (sc) T cell receptor analysis and scRNA velocity. To uncover molecules driving T cell polarization and plasticity, we established an in vivo pooled scCRISPR droplet sequencing (iCROP-seq) screen and applied it to mouse models of glomerulonephritis and colitis. CRISPR-based gene targeting in TH17 cells could be ranked according to the resulting transcriptional perturbations, and polarization biases into T helper 1 (TH1) and regulatory T cells could be quantified. Furthermore, we show that iCROP-seq can facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets by efficient functional stratification of genes and pathways in a disease- and tissue-specific manner. These findings uncover TH17 to TH1 cell plasticity in the human kidney in the context of renal autoimmunity. A single-cell in vivo CRISPR screen highlights genes driving T cell tissue adaptation and plasticity in autoimmunity. Editor’s summary Modulating plasticity in pathogenic T cells to promote a tolerogenic phenotype is a promising therapeutic approach in autoimmunity and cancer. To explore how pathogenic TH17 cell plasticity is regulated in mouse models of kidney and gut inflammation, Enk et al. optimized an in vivo pooled single-cell CRISPR droplet sequencing (iCROP-seq) screen. iCROP-seq enabled the assessment and quantification of CRISPR-modified TH17 cell polarization states in vivo. Furthermore, T cells from patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated glomerulonephritis exhibited plasticity. These findings indicate that iCROP-seq can be applied to preclinical mouse models of inflammation and suggest that targeting TH17 plasticity in patients with ANCA-glomerulonephritis is a promising therapeutic approach. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Introduction Ovarian and other peritoneal cancers have a strong tendency to metastasize into the surrounding adipose tissue. This study describes an effect of the adipose microenvironment on upregulation of sialic acid-containing glycans in ovarian cancer (OC). Heterogeneous populations of glycosylated OC tumors converged to a highly sialylated cell state that regulates tumorigenesis in an immune-dependent manner. Methods We modeled the adipose microenvironment by conditioning growth media with human patient-derived adipose tissue. OC cell lines grown in the presence vs. absence of adipose conditioned media (ACM) were characterized by transcriptomics, western blotting, and chemical biology glycan labeling methods. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to separate adipose-driven upregulation of hypersialylated (“SNA-high”) vs. hyposialylated (“SNA-low”) OC subpopulations. The two subpopulations were characterized by further transcriptomic and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, then injected into a syngeneic mouse model. Immune system involvement was implicated using wild type and athymic nude mice with a primary endpoint of overall survival. Results Adipose conditioning resulted in upregulation of sialyltransferases ST3GAL1, ST6GAL1, ST6GALNAC3, and ST8Sia1. In culture, OC cells displayed two distinct sialylated subpopulations that were stable for up to 9 passages, suggesting inherent heterogeneity in sialylation that is maintained throughout cell division and media changes. OC tumors that implanted in the omental adipose tissue exclusively reprogrammed to the highly sialylated subpopulation. In wild type C57BL/6 mice, only the hypersialylated SNA-high subpopulation implanted in the adipose, whereas the hyposialylated SNA-low subpopulation failed to be tumorigenic (p=0.023, n=5). In the single case where SNA-low established a tumor, post-mortem analysis revealed reprogramming of the tumor to the SNA-high state in vivo. In athymic nude mice, both subpopulations rapidly formed tumors, implicating a role of the adaptive immune system. Conclusions These findings suggest a model of glycan-dependent tumor evolution wherein the adipose microenvironment reprograms OC to a tumorigenic state that resists the adaptive immune system. Mechanistically, adipose factors upregulate sialyltransferases. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the effect of adipose microenvironment on OC tumor sialylation. Our results set the stage for translational applications targeting sialic acid pathways in OC and other peritoneal cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.">

        <tr id="Emerging immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy have revolutionized cancer treatment and have improved the survival of patients with multiple cancer types. Despite this success many patients are unresponsive to these treatments or relapse following treatment. CRISPR activation and knockout (KO) screens have been used to identify novel single gene targets that can enhance effector T cell function and promote immune cell targeting and eradication of tumors. However, cancer cells often employ multiple genes to promote an immunosuppressive pathway and thus modulating individual genes often has a limited effect. Paralogs are genes that originate from common ancestors and retain similar functions. They often have complex effects on a particular phenotype depending on factors like gene family similarity, each individual gene’s expression and the physiological or pathological context. Some paralogs exhibit synthetic lethal interactions in cancer cell survival; however, a thorough investigation of paralog pairs that could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy is lacking. Here we introduce a sensitive computational approach that uses sgRNA sets enrichment analysis to identify cancer-intrinsic paralog pairs which have the potential to synergistically enhance T cell-mediated tumor destruction. We have further developed an ensemble learning model that uses an XGBoost classifier and incorporates features such as gene characteristics, sequence and structural similarities, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and gene coevolution data to predict paralog pairs that are likely to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We experimentally validated the functional significance of these predicted paralog pairs using double knockout (DKO) of identified paralog gene pairs as compared to single gene knockouts (SKOs). These data and analyses collectively provide a sensitive approach to identify previously undetected paralog pairs that can enhance cancer immunotherapy even when individual genes within the pair has a limited effect.">

Recent studies have identified mitochondrial defects and autophagy as key players in the development of ccRCC. This study aims to delve into the changes in mitophagic activity within ccRCC and its impact on the tumor microenvironment, revealing its role in tumor cell metabolism, development, and survival strategies. Methods Comprehensive analysis of ccRCC tumor tissues using single cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the role of mitophagy in ccRCC. Mitophagy was determined to be altered among renal clear cells by gene set scoring. Key mitophagy cell populations and key prognostic genes were identified using NMF analysis and survival analysis approaches. The role of UBB in ccRCC was also demonstrated by in vitro experiments. Results Compared to normal kidney tissue, various cell types within ccRCC tumor tissues exhibited significantly increased levels of mitophagy, especially renal clear cells. Key genes associated with increased mitophagy levels, such as UBC, UBA52, TOMM7, UBB, MAP1LC3B, and CSNK2B, were identified, with their high expression closely linked to poor patient prognosis. Particularly, the ubiquitination process involving the UBB gene was found to be crucial for mitophagy and its quality control.

        <tr id="Cellular biomechanics plays critical roles in cancer metastasis and tumor progression. Existing studies on cancer cell biomechanics are mostly conducted in flat 2D conditions, where cells’ behavior can differ considerably from those in 3D physiological environments. Despite great advances in developing 3D in vitro models, probing cellular elasticity in 3D conditions remains a major challenge for existing technologies. In this work, we utilize optical Brillouin microscopy to longitudinally acquire mechanical images of growing cancerous spheroids over the period of eight days. The dense mechanical mapping from Brillouin microscopy enables us to extract spatially resolved and temporally evolving mechanical features that were previously inaccessible. Using an established machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate that incorporating these extracted mechanical features significantly improves the classification accuracy of cancer cells, from 74% to 95%. Building on this finding, we have developed a deep learning pipeline capable of accurately differentiating cancerous spheroids from normal ones solely using Brillouin images, suggesting the mechanical features of cancer cells could potentially serve as a new biomarker in cancer classification and detection.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Sarcoma encompasses a diverse group of cancers that are typically resistant to current therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The contexture of sarcomas limits generation of high-quality data using cutting-edge molecular profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq, thus hampering progress in understanding these understudied cancers.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Here, we demonstrate feasibility of producing multi-modal single-cell genomics and whole-genome sequencing data from frozen tissues, profiling 75,716 cell transcriptomes of five undifferentiated pleomorphic (UPS) and three intimal sarcomas (INS) samples, including paired specimens from two patients treated with ICB.


RESULTS
We find that genomic diversity decreases in patients with response to ICB, and, in unbiased analyses, identify cancer cell programs associated with therapy resistance. Although interactions of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes within the tumor ecosystem increase in ICB responders, clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells alone was insufficient to predict drug responses.


CONCLUSION
This study provides a framework for studying rare tumors and identifies salient and treatment-associated cancer cell intrinsic and tumor-microenvironmental features in sarcomas.">

        <tr id="Identifying host genetic factors modulating immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy has been experimentally challenging because of variations in both host and tumor genomes, differences in the microbiome, and patient life exposures. Utilizing the Collaborative Cross (CC) multi-parent mouse genetic resource population, we developed an approach that fixes the tumor genomic configuration while varying host genetics. With this approach, we discovered that response to anti-PD-1 (aPD1) immunotherapy was significantly heritable in four distinct murine tumor models (H2 between 0.18-0.40). For the MC38 colorectal carcinoma system (H2 = 0.40), we mapped four significant ICI response quantitative trait loci (QTL) localized to mouse chromosomes (mChr) 5, 9, 15 and 17, and identified significant epistatic interactions between specific QTL pairs. Differentially expressed genes within these QTL were highly enriched for immune genes and pathways mediating allograft rejection and graft vs host disease. Using a cross species analytical approach, we found a core network of 48 genes within the four QTLs that showed significant prognostic value for overall survival in aPD1 treated human cohorts that outperformed all other existing validated immunotherapy biomarkers, especially in human tumors of the previously defined immune subtype 4. Functional blockade of two top candidate immune targets within the 48 gene network, GM-CSF and high affinity IL-2/IL-15 signaling, completely abrogated the MC38 tumor transcriptional response to aPD1 therapy in vivo. Thus, we have established a powerful cross species in vivo platform capable of uncovering host genetic factors that establish the tumor immune microenvironment configuration propitious for ICI response.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) are critical regulators of anti-tumoral T-cell responses. The structure and abundance of intercellular contacts between cDC1 and CD8 T cells in cancer tissues is important to determine the outcome of the T-cell response. However, the molecular determinants controlling the stability of cDC1–CD8 interactions during cancer progression remain poorly investigated. Here, we generated a genetic model of non-small cell lung cancer crossed to a fluorescent cDC1 reporter (KP-XCR1venus) to allow the detection of cDC1-CD8T cell clusters in tumor tissues across tumor stages. We found that cDC1-CD8 clusters are abundant and productive at the early stages of tumor development but progressively diminish in advanced tumors. Transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry identified the adhesion molecule ALCAM/CD166 (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, ligand of CD6) as highly expressed by lung cDC1 and significantly downregulated in advanced tumors. Analysis of human datasets indicated that ALCAM is downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer and its expression correlates to better prognosis. Mechanistically, triggering ALCAM on lung cDC1 induces cytoskeletal remodeling and contact formation whereas its blockade prevents T-cell activation. Together, our results indicate that ALCAM is important to stabilize cDC1–CD8 interactions at early tumor stages, while its loss in advanced tumors contributes to immune evasion.">

        <tr id="Introduction Intra-tumoral B cells mediate a plethora of immune effector mechanisms with key roles in anti-tumor immunity and serve as positive prognostic indicators in a variety of solid tumor types, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Several aspects of intra-tumoral B cells remain unclear, such as their state of activation, antigenic repertoires, and capacity to mature into plasma cells. Methods B lymphocytes were isolated from primary EOC tissue and malignant ascites and were maintained in cell culture medium. The stably maintained cell lines were profiled with flow cytometry and B cell receptor sequencing. Secreted antibodies were tested with a human proteome array comprising more than 21,000 proteins, followed by ELISA for validation. Originating tumor samples were used for spatial profiling with chip cytometry. Results Antibody-secreting B lymphocytes were isolated from the ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME) of four different EOC patients. The highly clonal cell populations underwent spontaneous immortalization in vitro, were stably maintained in an antibody-secreting state, and showed presence of Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) proteins. All originating tumors had high frequency of tumor-infiltrating B cells, present as lymphoid aggregates, or tertiary lymphoid structures. The antigens recognized by three of the four cell lines are coil-coil domain containing protein 155 (CCDC155), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase2 (PDP2), respectively. Anti-CCDC155 circulating IgG antibodies were detected in 9 of 20 (45%) of EOC patients’ sera. Tissue analyses with multiparameter chip cytometry shows that the antibodies secreted by these novel human B cell lines engage their cognate antigens on tumor cells. Discussion These studies demonstrate that within the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte population in EOC resides a low frequency population of antibody-secreting B cells that have been naturally exposed to EBV. Once stably maintained, these novel cell lines offer unique opportunities for future studies on intratumor B cell biology and new target antigen recognition, and for studies on EBV latency and/or viral reactivation in the TME of non-EBV related solid tumors such as the EOC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between distinct brain regions and molecular subtypes in glioblastoma (GB), focusing on integrating modern statistical tools and molecular profiling to better understand the heterogeneity of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase wild-type (IDH-wt) gliomas. Methods This retrospective study comprised 441 patients diagnosed with new IDH-wt glioma between 2009 and 2020 at Heidelberg University Hospital. The diagnostic process included preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and molecular characterization, encompassing IDH-status determination and subclassification, through DNA-methylation profiling. To discern and map distinct brain regions associated with specific methylation subtypes, a support-vector regression-based lesion-symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) was employed. Lesion maps were adjusted to 2 mm³ resolution. Significance was assessed with beta maps, using a threshold of P < .005, with 10 000 permutations and a cluster size minimum of 100 voxels. Results Of 441 initially screened glioma patients, 423 (95.9%) met the inclusion criteria. Following DNA-methylation profiling, patients were classified into RTK II (40.7%), MES (33.8%), RTK I (18%), and other methylation subclasses (7.6%). Between molecular subtypes, there was no difference in tumor volume. Using SVR-LSM, distinct brain regions correlated with each subclass were identified: MES subtypes were associated with left-hemispheric regions involving the superior temporal gyrus and insula cortex, RTK I with right frontal regions, and RTK II with 3 clusters in the left hemisphere. Conclusions This study linked molecular diversity and spatial features in glioblastomas using SVR-LSM. Future studies should validate these findings in larger, independent cohorts to confirm the observed patterns.">

 Single cell and multiplex imaging modalities have opened new insights into the organization and architecture of the immune microenvironment of cancer. Our group was one of the first to demonstrate these methods in the analysis of Hodgkin [1,2] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3]. Most recently, we demonstrated that spatial biomarkers outperform gene-expression biomarkers in predicting relapse after autologous transplant [4]. Here we present previously unpublished data demonstrating single cell multiplexed spatial analysis, using the imaging mass cytometry platform, in a cohort of 426 patients with large cell lymphoma. Gene expression and mutational analysis are available for a majority of cases allowing us to correlate spatial signature with genetic classes such as LymphGen [5], and deconvolution methods such as EcoTyper [6]. Using this cohort, we identify spatial biomarkers that improve prediction of clinical outcomes beyond cell of origin or genetic subgroup and identify novel targets for clinical development. Finally, we will present our approaches to move our discovery level spatial profiling into clinical diagnostic space through application of automated multiplex immunofluorescence imaging and a machine learning based image analysis pipeline.

By exploring the current state of the field, we identify and describe the central mechanisms that determine sarcomagenesis. Further, we discuss seminal studies in translational genomics, which enabled epigenetic characterization of fusion-driven sarcomas. Important context for epigenetic mechanisms include, but are not limited to, cell cycle and metabolism, core regulatory circuitry, 3-dimensional chromatin architectural dysregulation, integration with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and translational animal modeling. Paradoxically, while the genetic requirements for oncogenic transformation are highly specific for the fusion partners, the epigenetic mechanisms we as a community have uncovered are categorically very broad. This dichotomy prompts the question of whether the investigation of rare disease epigenomics should prioritize studying individual cell populations, thereby examining whether the mechanisms of chromatin dysregulation are specific to a particular tumor. We review recent advances focusing on rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, undifferentiated round cell sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myxoid/round liposarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and desmoplastic round cell tumor. The growing number of groundbreaking discoveries in the field, motivated us to anticipate further exciting advances in the area of mechanistic epigenomics and direct targeting of fusion transcription factors in the years ahead.">

Immunotherapies, including vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy, represent promising avenues for GBM treatment. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive TME, and BBB restrictiveness hinder their effectiveness.

        <tr id="Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the seventh most common cancer globally, resulting in 440 000 deaths per year. While there have been advancements in chemoradiotherapy and surgery, relapse occurs in more than half of HNCs, and these patients have a median survival of 10 months and a 2-year survival of < 20%. Only a subset of patients displays durable benefits from immunotherapies in metastatic and recurrent HNC, making it critical to understand the tumor microenvironment (TME) underpinning therapy responses in HNC. To recognize biological differences within the TME that may be predictive of immunotherapy response, we applied cutting-edge geospatial whole-transcriptome profiling (NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler) and spatial proteomics profiling (Akoya PhenoCycler-Fusion) on a tumor microarray consisting of 25 cores from 12 patients that included 4 immunotherapy-unresponsive (8 cores) and 2 immunotherapy-responsive patients (5 cores), as well as 6 immunotherapy naïve patients (12 cores). Through high-plex, regional-based transcriptomic mapping of the tumor and TME, pathways involved with the complement system and hypoxia were identified to be differentially expressed in patients who went on to experience a poor immunotherapy response. Single-cell, targeted proteomic analysis found that immune cell infiltration of the cancer cell mass and interactions of CD8 T cells with tumor and other immune cells were associated with positive immunotherapy response. The relative abundance of specific tumor phenotypes and their interactions with various immune cells was identified to be different between response groups. This study demonstrates how spatial transcriptomics and proteomics can resolve novel alterations in the TME of HNC that may contribute to therapy sensitivity and resistance.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered a low immunogenic tumor with "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) and is mostly unresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Here we decipher the impact of intratumoral heterogeneity of immune determinants on antitumor response.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We performed spatial proteomic and transcriptomic analyses and multiplexed immunofluorescence on multiple tumor regions, including tumor center (TC) and invasive front (IF), from 220 PDAC-patients, classified according to their transcriptomic immune signaling into high-immunogenic (HI-PDACs, n=54) and low-immunogenic tumors (LI-PDACs, n=166). Spatial compartments (tumor: Pancytokeratin+/CD45- and leukocytes: Pancytokeratin-/CD45+) were defined by fluorescent imaging.


RESULTS
HI-PDACs exhibited higher densities of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with upregulation of T-cell priming-associated immune determinants, including CD40, ITGAM, GITR, CXCL10, GZMB, IFNG and HLA-DR, which was significantly more prominent at the IF than the TC. In contrast, LI-PDACs exhibited immune evasive TMEs with downregulation of immune determinants and a negative gradient from TC to IF. Patients with HI-PDACs had significantly better outcomes; however, they showed more frequently exhausted immune phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate strategic differences in the regulation of immune determinants, which lead to different levels of effectiveness of antitumor responses between high- and low-immunogenic tumors and dynamic spatial changes, which affect the evolution of immune evasion and patient outcomes. This supports coevolution of tumor and immune cells and may help define therapeutic vulnerabilities to improve antitumor immunity and harness the responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors in PDAC patients.">

        <tr id="Somatic evolution in ageing tissues underlies many cancers. However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Glioma is the most frequent and lethal form of primary brain tumor. The molecular mechanism of oncogenesis and progression of glioma still remains unclear, rendering the therapeutic effect of conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical resection insufficient. In this study, we sought to explore the function of HEC1 (highly expressed in cancer 1) in glioma; a component of the NDC80 complex in glioma is crucial in the regulation of kinetochore. Methods Bulk RNA and scRNA‐seq analyses were used to infer HEC1 function, and in vitro experiments validated its function. Results HEC1 overexpression was observed in glioma and was indicative of poor prognosis and malignant clinical features, which was confirmed in human glioma tissues. High HEC1 expression was correlated with more active cell cycle, DNA‐associated activities, and the formation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including interaction with immune cells, and correlated strongly with infiltrating immune cells and enhanced expression of immune checkpoints. In vitro experiments and RNA‐seq further confirmed the role of HEC1 in promoting cell proliferation, and the expression of DNA replication and repair pathways in glioma. Coculture assay confirmed that HEC1 promotes microglial migration and the transformation of M1 phenotype macrophage to M2 phenotype. Conclusion Altogether, these findings demonstrate that HEC1 may be a potential prognostic marker and an immunotherapeutic target in glioma.">

        <tr id="Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an epithelial neuroendocrine form of lung cancer for which survival rates remain dismal and new therapeutic approaches are greatly needed. Key biological features of SCLC tumors include fast growth and widespread metastasis, as well as rapid resistance to treatment. Similar to pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, SCLC cells have traits of both hormone-producing cells and neurons. Here we specifically discuss the neuronal features of SCLC. We consider how neuronal G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other neuronal molecules on the surface of SCLC cells can contribute to the growth of SCLC tumors and serve as therapeutic targets in SCLC. We also review recent evidence for the role of neuronal programs expressed by SCLC cells in the fast proliferation, migration, and metastasis of these cells. We further highlight how these neuronal programs may be particularly relevant for the development of brain metastases, and how they can assist SCLC cells to functionally interact with neurons and astrocytes. A greater understanding of the molecular and cellular neuronal features of SCLC is likely to uncover new vulnerabilities in SCLC cells, which may help develop novel therapeutic approaches. More generally, the epithelial-to-neuronal transition (ENT) observed during tumor progression in SCLC and other cancer types can contribute significantly to tumor development and response to therapy.">

        <tr id="Bone pain is a presenting feature of bone cancers such as osteosarcoma (OS), relayed by skeletal-innervating peripheral afferent neurons. Potential functions of tumor-associated sensory neurons in bone cancers beyond pain sensation are unknown. To uncover neural regulatory functions, a chemical-genetic approach in mice with a knock-in allele for TrkA was used to functionally perturb sensory nerve innervation during OS growth and disease progression. TrkA inhibition in transgenic mice led to significant reductions in sarcoma-associated sensory innervation and vascularization, tumor growth and metastasis, and prolonged overall survival. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that sarcoma denervation was associated with phenotypic alterations in both OS tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment, and with reduced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. Multimodal and multi-omics analyses of human OS bone samples and human dorsal root ganglia neurons further implicated peripheral innervation and neurotrophin signaling in OS tumor biology. In order to curb tumor-associated axonal ingrowth, we next leveraged FDA-approved bupivacaine liposomes leading to significant reductions in sarcoma growth, vascularity, as well as alleviation of pain. In sum, TrkA-expressing peripheral neurons positively regulate key aspects of OS progression and sensory neural inhibition appears to disrupt calcitonin receptor signaling (CALCR) and VEGF signaling within the sarcoma microenvironment leading to significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival. These data suggest that interventions to prevent pathological innervation of osteosarcoma represent a novel adjunctive therapy to improve clinical outcomes and survival.">

        <tr id="Over decades, cancer understanding has advanced significantly at molecular and cellular levels, leading to various therapies based on intra-/inter-cellular networks. Despite this, cancer still remains a leading cause of death globally. The primary driver of cancer mortality is metastasis, responsible for about 90% of cancer deaths, due to unclear pathophysiological mechanisms that complicate treatment development. The Notch signaling pathway, a crucial intercellular network in many cancers, has been extensively studied and therapies targeting the Notch pathway also have been well-studied based on inhibiting various stages of Notch activation. On the other hand, Notch signaling’s role varies between cancers; for instance, in non-small cell lung cancer, Notch1 and Notch2 have opposing effects compared to their roles in embryonal brain tumors. In this study, we assumed a scenario of multiple cancers with contrasting Notch signaling pathways and explored optimal targeted therapies for reducing cancer cells by developing two mathematical models with contrasting Notch signaling pathways. The proposed therapies were compared with existing ones, and strategies were investigated to reduce cancer cell numbers for different stage of cancer. We found that that multiple cancers with contrasting Notch networks can be controlled by a common targeted signal network. Combination therapy enhancing Notch production may be most effective in early-stage cancer, while cleavage therapies may be more effective in late-stage cancer. Our study also suggests that optimal treatment should consider the cancer stage, with careful selection and ordering of medication therapies.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma poses a formidable challenge among primary brain tumors: its tumorigenic stem cells, capable of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation, contribute substantially to tumor initiation and therapy resistance. These glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), resembling conventional stem and progenitor cells, adopt pathways critical for tissue development and repair, promoting uninterrupted tumor expansion. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a substantial component of the human transcriptome, have garnered considerable interest for their pivotal roles in normal physiological processes and cancer pathogenesis. They display cell- or tissue-specific expression patterns, and extensive investigations have highlighted their impact on regulating GSC properties and cellular differentiation, thus offering promising avenues for therapeutic interventions. Consequently, lncRNAs, with their ability to exert regulatory control over tumor initiation and progression, have emerged as promising targets for innovative glioblastoma therapies. This review explores notable examples of GSC-associated lncRNAs and elucidates their functional roles in driving glioblastoma progression. Additionally, we delved deeper into utilizing a 3D in vitro model for investigating GSC biology and elucidated four primary methodologies for targeting lncRNAs as potential therapeutics in managing glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="CD36 expression in both immune and non-immune cells is known to be directly involved in cancer metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by malignant melanocytes play a vital role in developing tumor-promoting microenvironments, but it is unclear whether this is mediated through CD36. To understand the role of CD36 in melanoma, we first analyzed the SKCM dataset for clinical prognosis, evaluated the percentage of CD36 in lymphatic fluid-derived EVs (LEVs), and tested whether melanoma-derived EVs increase CD36 expression and induce M2-macrophage-like characteristics. Furthermore, we performed a multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging analysis to evaluate the CD36 expression and its colocalization with various other cells in the lymph node (LN) of patients and control subjects. Our findings show that cutaneous melanoma patients have a worse clinical prognosis with high CD36 levels, and a higher percentage of CD36 in total LEVs were found at baseline in melanoma patients compared to control. We also found that monocytic and endothelial cells treated with melanoma EVs expressed more CD36 than untreated cells. Furthermore, melanoma-derived EVs can regulate immunosuppressive macrophage-like characteristics by upregulating CD36. The spatial imaging data show that cells in tumor-involved sentinel LNs exhibit a higher probability of CD36 expression than cells from control LNs, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusively, our findings demonstrated that CD36 plays a vital role in controlling the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the LN, which can promote the formation of a protumorigenic niche.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) accounts for up to 15% of all kidney cancer cases, yet our understanding of its tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remains limited. We utilized multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to evaluate immune cell spatial architecture in pRCC and compared to that of clear cell RCC (ccRCC). Methods Surgical tumor specimens were obtained from localized RCC tumors, followed by mIF using markers for T cells, B cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Spatial data were derived in regions of interest (ROIs) manually selected from spatially distinct tissue compartments of the TIME. Single-cell ST was performed on a subset of patient samples, utilizing probes against 960 transcripts. Cell abundance, cell spatial clustering, and spatially varying gene expression were analyzed to identify unique features of the TIME in pRCC. Results Sixteen pRCC and 70 ccRCC patient samples underwent mIF. Compared to ccRCC, global pRCC immune cell abundance was statistically lower amongst functional CD8 T cells, while global cell spatial clustering was higher amongst M2-like macrophages as measured by mIF, including PDL1+ subsets. Using ST, seven genes were significantly associated with spatial clustering of M2-like macrophages in pRCC. Three of seven genes (CCL18, GPNMB, CD9) are known markers of lipid-associated TAMs (LAMs) (adjusted p-value < 0.1). Conclusions Compared to ccRCC, pRCC has fewer T cells but greater M2-like macrophage spatial clustering. Using ST, we found that multiple LAM-associated genes are spatially enriched in pRCC. Additional resources should be dedicated to investigating myeloid biomarkers and the impact of myeloid modulating therapeutics in pRCC.">

        <tr id="Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, particularly in advanced stages where concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is used for treatment. However, resistance to CCRT poses a significant challenge, often leading to treatment failure and disease progression. This study explores the tumor microenvironment (TME) of hypopharyngeal SCC to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying CCRT resistance. Using spatial transcriptomics (ST), we analyzed tissue samples from patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal SCC, distinguishing between those who were CCRT-resistant and those who were CCRT-naive. The analysis revealed six distinct cellular clusters within the TME, including a prominent epithelio-immune cellular area in CCRT-resistant tissues. SPP1 was identified as a key gene with significantly higher expression in CCRT-resistant samples, specifically within macrophages. Further investigation showed that SPP1+ macrophages interacted with malignant epithelial cells through SPP1-CD44 and SPP1-ITGB1 ligand-receptor pairs. These interactions were primarily localized in the peri-tumoral and intra-tumoral regions, highlighting their potential role in driving CCRT resistance. Our findings suggest that SPP1+ macrophages contribute to the resistant phenotype in hypopharyngeal SCC by modulating the TME and interacting with cancer cells. Understanding these interactions offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of CCRT resistance and may inform the development of targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in the progression of cancer tumours and can make treatment significantly less successful for patients. EMT occurs when a cell gains a different phenotype and possesses different behaviours to those previously exhibited. This may result in enhanced drug resistance, higher cell plasticity, and increased metastatic abilities. It has therefore has become essential to encapsulate this change and study tumour progression and its response to treatments. Here, we use a 3D agent-based multiscale modelling framework based on Physicell to investigate the role of EMT over time in two cell lines, OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3. The impact of conditions in the microenvironment are incorporated into the model by modifying cellular behaviours dependant on variables such as substrate concentrations and proximity to neighbouring cells. OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cell lines possess highly contrasting tumour layouts, allowing a vast array of different tumour dynamics and morphologies to be tested and studied. The model encapsulates the biological observations and trends seen in tumour growth and development, thus can help to obtain further insights into OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cell line dynamics. Sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the impact of parameter sensitivity on model outcome. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters used in generating the rate of EMT and cycle rates within the cells are relatively more sensitive than other parameters used.">

        <tr id="Despite extensive research efforts, cancer continues to stand as one of the leading causes of death on a global scale. To gain profound insights into the intricate mechanisms underlying cancer onset and progression, it is imperative to possess methodologies that allow the study of cancer cells at the single-cell level, focusing on critical parameters such as cell morphology, metabolism, and molecular characteristics. These insights are essential for effectively discerning between healthy and cancerous cells and comprehending tumoral progression. Recent advancements in microscopy techniques have significantly advanced the study of cancer cells, with Raman microspectroscopy (RM) emerging as a particularly powerful tool. Indeed, RM can provide both biochemical and spatial details at the single-cell level without the need for labels or causing disruptions to cell integrity. Moreover, RM can be correlated with other microscopy techniques, creating a synergy that offers a spectrum of complementary insights into cancer cell morphology and biology. This review aims to explore the correlation between RM and other microscopy techniques such as confocal fluoresce microscopy (CFM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), digital holography microscopy (DHM), and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Each of these techniques has their own strengths, providing different perspectives and parameters about cancer cell features. The correlation between information from these various analysis methods is a valuable tool for physicians and researchers, aiding in the comprehension of cancer cell morphology and biology, unraveling mechanisms underlying cancer progression, and facilitating the development of early diagnosis and/or monitoring cancer progression.">

        <tr id="Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a multifaceted condition characterized by significant diversity in its molecular and pathological subtypes and clinical manifestation. Despite the progress made in the treatment of DLBCL through the development of novel drugs, an estimated one-third of patients encounter relapse or acquire refractory disease. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of DLBCL, a complex network consisting of cellular and noncellular components that engage in interactions with the tumor, is a parameter that is gaining increasing attention. The TME comprises both the immune and nonimmune microenvironments. The immune microenvironment comprises natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T and B lymphocytes. The nonimmune microenvironment consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells, and other molecules that are secreted. Despite ongoing research, the exact impact of these components and their interaction on the progression of the disease remains elusive. A comprehensive review of significant discoveries concerning the cellular and noncellular constituents, molecular characteristics, and treatment response and prognosis of the TME in DLBCL, as well as the potential targeting of the TME with novel therapeutic approaches, is provided in this article.">

        <tr id="Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) are characterized by the presence of either a single enlarged nucleus or multiple nuclei and are closely associated with tumor progression and treatment resistance. These cells contribute significantly to cellular heterogeneity and can arise from various stressors, including radiation, chemotherapy, hypoxia, and environmental factors. The formation of PGCCs can occur through mechanisms such as endoreplication, cell fusion, cytokinesis failure, mitotic slippage, or cell cannibalism. Notably, PGCCs exhibit traits similar to cancer stem cells (CSCs) and generate highly invasive progeny through asymmetric division. The presence of PGCCs and their progeny is pivotal in conferring resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, as well as facilitating tumor recurrence and metastasis. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the origins, potential formation mechanisms, stressors, unique characteristics, and regulatory pathways of PGCCs, alongside therapeutic strategies targeting these cells.

        <tr id="Objectives To determine the dysregulated signaling pathways of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma associated with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) via single-cell molecular characterization. Introduction Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a significant global burden and is a disease with poor survival. Despite trials exploring new treatment modalities to improve disease control rates, the 5 year survival rate remains low at only 60%. Most cancer malignancies are reported to progress to a fatal phase due to the metastatic activity derived from treatment-resistant cancer cells, regarded as one of the most significant obstacles to develope effective cancer treatment options. However, the molecular profiles of cancer cells have not been thoroughly studied. Methods Here, we examined in-situ HNSCC tumors and pairwisely followed up with the downstream circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-based on the surrogate biomarkers to detect metastasis that is established in other cancers – not yet being fully adopted in HNSCC treatment algorithms. Results Specifically, we revealed metastatic HNSCC patients have complex CTCs that could be defined through gene expression and mutational gene profiling derived from completed single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) that served to confirm molecular pathways inherent in these CTCs. To enhance the reliability of our findings, we cross-validated those molecular profiles with results from previously published studies. Conclusion Thus, we identified 5 dysregulated signaling pathways in CTCs to derive HNSCC biomarker panels for screening HNSCC in situ tumors.">

        <tr id="Substantial heterogeneity in molecular features, patient prognoses, and therapeutic responses in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) highlights the urgent need to develop molecular classifications that reliably and accurately reflect tumor behavior and inform personalized therapy. Here, we leveraged the similarity network fusion bioinformatics approach to jointly analyze multi-omics datasets spanning copy number variations, somatic mutations, DNA methylation, and transcriptomic profiling and derived a prognostic classification system for HNSCC. The integrative model consistently identified three subgroups (IMC1-3) with specific genomic features, biological characteristics, and clinical outcomes across multiple independent cohorts. The IMC1 subgroup included proliferative, immune-activated tumors and exhibited a more favorable prognosis. The IMC2 subtype harbored activated EGFR signaling and an inflamed tumor microenvironment with cancer-associated fibroblast/vascular infiltrations. Alternatively, the IMC3 group featured highly aberrant metabolic activities and impaired immune infiltration and recruiting. Pharmacogenomics analyses from in silico predictions and from patient-derived xenograft model data unveiled subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities including sensitivity to cisplatin and immunotherapy in IMC1 and EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi) in IMC2, which was experimentally validated in patient-derived organoid models. Two signatures for prognosis and EGFRi sensitivity were developed via machine learning. Together, this integrative multi-omics clustering for HNSCC improves current understanding of tumor heterogeneity and facilitates patient stratification and therapeutic development tailored to molecular vulnerabilities.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease and the management of relapses is one of the biggest clinical challenges. TP53 alterations are established high‐risk markers and are included in the current disease staging criteria. KRAS is the most frequently mutated gene affecting around 20% of MM patients. Applying Clonal Competition Assays (CCA) by co‐culturing color‐labeled genetically modified cell models, we recently showed that mono‐ and biallelic alterations in TP53 transmit a fitness advantage to the cells. Here, we report a similar dynamic for two mutations in KRAS (G12A and A146T), providing a biological rationale for the high frequency of KRAS and TP53 alterations at MM relapse. Resistance mutations, on the other hand, did not endow MM cells with a general fitness advantage but rather presented a disadvantage compared to the wild‐type. CUL4B KO and IKZF1 A152T transmit resistance against immunomodulatory agents, PSMB5 A20T to proteasome inhibition. However, MM cells harboring such lesions only outcompete the culture in the presence of the respective drug. To better prevent the selection of clones with the potential of inducing relapse, these results argue in favor of treatment‐free breaks or a switch of the drug class given as maintenance therapy. In summary, the fitness benefit of TP53 and KRAS mutations was not treatment‐related, unlike patient‐derived drug resistance alterations that may only induce an advantage under treatment. CCAs are suitable models for the study of clonal evolution and competitive (dis)advantages conveyed by a specific genetic lesion of interest, and their dependence on external factors such as the treatment.">

        <tr id="Mutations in polymerases Pold1 and Pole exonuclease domains in humans are associated with increased cancer incidence, elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB) and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Although ICB is approved for treatment of several cancers, not all tumors with elevated TMB respond. Here we generated Pold1 and Pole proofreading mutator mice and show that ICB treatment of mice with high TMB tumors did not improve survival as only a subset of tumors responded. Similarly, introducing the mutator alleles into mice with Kras/p53 lung cancer did not improve survival, however, passaging mutator tumor cells in vitro without immune editing caused rejection in immune-competent hosts, demonstrating the efficiency by which cells with antigenic mutations are eliminated. Finally, ICB treatment of mutator mice earlier, before observable tumors delayed cancer onset, improved survival, and selected for tumors without aneuploidy, suggesting the use of ICB in individuals at high risk for cancer prevention. Highlights Germline somatic and conditional Pold1 and Pole exonuclease domain mutations in mice produce a mutator phenotype. Spontaneous cancers arise in mutator mice that have genomic features comparable to human tumors with these mutations. ICB treatment of mutator mice with tumors did not improve survival as only a subset of tumors respond. Introduction of the mutator alleles into an autochthonous mouse lung cancer model also did not produce immunogenic tumors, whereas passaging mutator tumor cells in vitro caused immune rejection indicating efficient selection against antigenic mutations in vivo. Prophylactic ICB treatment delayed cancer onset, improved survival, and selected for tumors with no aneuploidy. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma cell lines derived from different patients are widely used in tumor biology research and drug screening. A key feature of glioblastoma is the high level of inter- and intratumor heterogeneity that accounts for treatment resistance. Our aim was to investigate whether intratumor heterogeneity is maintained in cell models. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to investigate the cellular composition of a tumor sample and six patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines. Three cell lines preserved the mutational profile of the original tumor, whereas three others differed from their precursors. Copy-number variation analysis showed significantly rearranged genomes in all the cell lines and in the tumor sample. The tumor had the most complex cell composition, including cancer cells and microenvironmental cells. Cell lines with a conserved genome had less diverse cellularity, and during cultivation, a relative increase in the stem-cell-derived progenitors was noticed. Cell lines with genomes different from those of the primary tumors mainly contained neural progenitor cells and microenvironmental cells. The establishment of cell lines without the driver mutations that are intrinsic to the original tumors may be related to the selection of clones or cell populations during cultivation. Thus, patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines differ substantially in their cellular profile, which should be taken into account in translational studies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with histological sarcomatoid de-differentiation (sRCC) has a historically poor prognosis across all RCC subtypes. Recently, immunotherapy with anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA4 combo has significantly improved disease-specific survival, and complete response are seen in upwards of 20% of patients. However, half of sRCC patients still have no response to this immunotherapy, and the mechanism of response remains unclear. Methods Our preliminary bulk RNA sequencing data reveal a distinct tumor microenvironment (TME) in human sRCC tumors, characterized by heightened immune cell infiltration, particularly enriched for regulatory T cells (Tregs). Subsequently, we delineated the spatial gene expression topography within sRCC and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) regions, culminating in the development of the sRCC signature. Concurrently, we established an innovative immunocompetent murine model of sRCC. Leveraging CRISPR technology, we replicated the human sRCC genotype by knocking out Vhl, Bap1, and Cdkn2a/2b genes in a mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTERT) overexpressing renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line. This effort yielded a successfully engineered mouse implantable sRCC cell line bearing VhlMutBap1DelCdkn2aDelCdkn2bDel (HJRCC68N). Results The syngeneic mouse sRCC model we developed faithfully replicates human sRCC histology and tumor microenvironment and recapitulates the sRCC signature identified in human sRCC regions. Importantly, like in humans, mouse sRCC tumors exhibit a heterogeneous response to anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA4 combination, and anti-CTLA4 monotherapy, reflecting the clinical variability observed in human patients. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis from our mouse model reveals the involvement of type 1 immunity in responder, providing insights into overcoming immunotherapy resistance. Conclusions In conclusion, our study unveiled distinct changes in the TME at the transcriptomic and spatial gene expression levels in human sRCC. Leveraging our novel murine model, which faithfully replicates human sRCC histology, TME characteristics, and mixed response to immunotherapy, we elucidated the involvement of type 1 immunity in treatment response. These insights offer valuable pathways for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and pave the way for the development of tailored treatment strategies aimed at improving outcomes for sRCC patients.">

We unveil diverse canine IC expression patterns and unique human IC signatures that reflect the histological type and primary site of cancer. We uncover a striking similarity between canine brain cancers, osteosarcoma, and their human counterparts, identifying them as prospective immunotherapy models. Four ICs—CD160, A2AR, NKG2A, and OX40—are key to the differences observed between species. Moreover, individual patient IC signatures exhibit varying alignment with their respective cancer types, a finding with profound implications for personalized human therapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Novel therapies targeting KRAS offer treatment options for previously untreatable patients. However, in colorectal cancer (CRC), resistance to KRAS-targeted therapy develops rapidly, making it imperative to understand its underlying mechanisms. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to therapy resistance by generating and maintaining the cancer stem cell niche. This study investigates whether CAF-secreted factors induce resistance to KRAS inhibition by enhancing cancer stemness. Our findings demonstrate that while KRAS silencing reduced the expression of stem cell markers and stemness, CAF-secreted factors counteracted those effects by activating pro-tumorigenic pathways, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and increasing cell proliferation. Overall, we provide novel mechanistic insights into how CAF-secreted factors oppose KRAS silencing-induced growth inhibition, which may be crucial for improving CRC therapy. Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) responses to KRAS-targeted inhibition have been limited due to low response rates, the mechanisms of which remain unknown. Herein, we explored the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secretome as a mediator of resistance to KRAS silencing. CRC cell lines HCT15, HCT116, and SW480 were cultured either in recommended media or in conditioned media from a normal colon fibroblast cell line (CCD-18Co) activated with rhTGF-β1 to induce a CAF-like phenotype. The expression of membrane stem cell markers was analyzed by flow cytometry. Stem cell potential was evaluated by a sphere formation assay. RNAseq was performed in KRAS-silenced HCT116 colonospheres treated with either control media or conditioned media from CAFs. Our results demonstrated that KRAS-silencing up-regulated CD24 and down-regulated CD49f and CD104 in the three cell lines, leading to a reduction in sphere-forming efficiency. However, CAF-secreted factors restored stem cell marker expression and increased stemness. RNA sequencing showed that CAF-secreted factors up-regulated genes associated with pro-tumorigenic pathways in KRAS-silenced cells, including KRAS, TGFβ, NOTCH, WNT, MYC, cell cycle progression and exit from quiescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immune regulation. Overall, our results suggest that resistance to KRAS-targeted inhibition might derive not only from cell-intrinsic causes but also from external elements, such as fibroblast-secreted factors.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor structure is heterogeneous and complex, and it is difficult to obtain complete characteristics by two‐dimensional analysis. The aim of this study was to visualize and characterize volumetric vascular information of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors using whole tissue phenotyping and three‐dimensional light‐sheet microscopy. Here, we used the diagnosing immunolabeled paraffin‐embedded cleared organs pipeline for tissue clearing, immunolabeling, and three‐dimensional imaging. The spatial distributions of CD34, which targets blood vessels, and LYVE‐1, which targets lymphatic vessels, were examined by calculating three‐dimensional density, vessel length, vessel radius, and density curves, such as skewness, kurtosis, and variance of the expression. We then examined those associations with ccRCC outcomes and genetic alteration state. Formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded tumor samples from 46 ccRCC patients were included in the study. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed the associations between blood vessel and lymphatic vessel distributions and pathological factors such as a high nuclear grade, large tumor size, and the presence of venous invasion. Furthermore, three‐dimensional imaging parameters stratified ccRCC patients regarding survival outcomes. An analysis of genomic alterations based on volumetric vascular information parameters revealed that PI3K‐mTOR pathway mutations related to the blood vessel radius were significantly different. Collectively, we have shown that the spatial elucidation of volumetric vasculature information could be prognostic and may serve as a new biomarker for genomic alterations. High‐end tissue clearing techniques and volumetric immunohistochemistry enable three‐dimensional analysis of tumors, leading to a better understanding of the microvascular structure in the tumor space.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells play pivotal roles in combating intracellular pathogens and eliminating malignant cells in cancer. However, the prognostic role of CD8+ T cells in ovarian carcinoma is insufficiently exploited. Herein, through univariate Cox regression along with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses, we developed a novel prognostic model based on CD8+ T cell markers identified by single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. Patient grouping by the median risk score reveals an excellent prognostic efficacy of this model in both training and validation cohorts. Of note, patients classified as low-risk group exhibit a dramatically improved prognosis. In addition, higher enrichment level of immune-related pathways and increased infiltration level of multiple immune cells are found in patients with lower risk score. Importantly, low-risk patients also exhibited higher response rate to immunotherapies. Summarily, this developed CD8+ T cell-associated prognostic model serves as an excellent predictor for clinical outcomes and aids in guiding therapeutic strategy choices for ovarian cancer patients.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
In multiple myeloma (MM), therapy-induced clonal evolution is associated with treatment resistance and is one of the most important hindrances toward a cure for MM. To further understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the clonal evolution of MM, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to paired diagnostic and post-treatment bone marrow (BM) samples.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
scRNA-seq was performed on 38 BM samples from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (n = 1), MM patients at diagnosis (n = 19), MM post-treatment (n = 17), and one healthy donor. The single-cell transcriptome data of malignant plasma cells and the surrounding immune microenvironment were analyzed.


RESULTS
Profiling by scRNA-seq data revealed three primary trajectories of transcriptional evolution after treatment: clonal elimination in patients with undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD-), as well as clonal stabilization and clonal selection in detectable MRD (MRD+) patients. We noted a metabolic shift towards fatty acid oxidation in cycling-resistant plasma cells (PCs), while selective PCs favored the NF-κB pathway. Intriguingly, when comparing the genetic and transcriptional dynamics, we found a significant correlation between genetic and non-genetic factors in driving the clonal evolution. Furthermore, we identified variations in cellular interactions between malignant plasma cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Selective PCs showed the most robust cellular interactions with the TME.


CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that MM cells could rapidly adapt to induction treatment through transcriptional adaptation, metabolic adaptation, and specialized immune evasion. Targeting therapy-induced resistance mechanisms may help to avert refractory disease in multiple myeloma.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous disease, posing challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Cancer immunotherapy has recently emerged as a promising option for patients with advanced and drug-resistant cancers. Fibroblasts, a significant component of the tumor microenvironment, play a crucial role in tumor progression, but their precise function in BLCA remains uncertain.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for BLCA were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The R package "Seurat" was used for processing scRNA-seq data, with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for downscaling and cluster identification. The FindAllMarkers function identified marker genes for each cluster. Differentially expressed genes influencing overall survival (OS) of BLCA patients were identified using the limma package. Differences in clinicopathological characteristics, immune microenvironment, immune checkpoints, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity between high- and low-risk groups were investigated. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry validated the expression of prognostic genes.


RESULTS
Fibroblast marker genes identified three molecular subtypes in the testing set. A prognostic signature comprising ten genes stratified BLCA patients into high- and low-score groups. This signature was validated in one internal and two external validation sets. High-score patients exhibited increased immune cell infiltration, elevated chemokine expression, and enhanced immune checkpoint expression but had poorer OS and a reduced response to immunotherapy. Six sensitive anti-tumor drugs were identified for the high-score group. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry showed that CERCAM, TM4SF1, FN1, ANXA1, and LOX were highly expressed, while EMP1, HEYL, FBN1, and SLC2A3 were downregulated in BLCA.


CONCLUSION
A novel fibroblast marker gene-based signature was established, providing robust predictions of survival and immunotherapeutic response in BLCA patients.">

        <tr id="Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in never-smoker patients. However, these mutations are not always carcinogenic, and have recently been reported in histologically normal lung tissue from patients with and without lung cancer. To investigate the outcome of EGFR mutation in healthy lung stem cells, we grow murine alveolar type II organoids monoclonally in a three-dimensional Matrigel. Our experiments show that the EGFR-L858R mutation induces a change in organoid structure: mutated organoids display more ‘budding’, in comparison with non-mutant controls, which are nearly spherical. We perform on-lattice computational simulations, which suggest that this can be explained by the concentration of division among a small number of cells on the surface of the mutated organoids. We are currently unable to distinguish the cell-based mechanisms that lead to this spatial heterogeneity in growth, but suggest a number of future experiments which could be used to do so. We suggest that the likelihood of L858R-fuelled tumorigenesis is affected by whether the mutation arises in a spatial environment that allows the development of these surface protrusions. These data may have implications for cancer prevention strategies and for understanding NSCLC progression.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells show remarkable plasticity and can switch lineages in response to the tumor microenvironment. Cellular plasticity drives invasiveness and metastasis and helps cancer cells to evade therapy by developing resistance to radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Increased understanding of cell fate determination through epigenetic reprogramming is critical to discover how cancer cells achieve transcriptomic and phenotypic plasticity. Glioblastoma is a perfect example of cancer evolution where cells retain an inherent level of plasticity through activation or maintenance of progenitor developmental programs. However, the principles governing epigenetic drivers of cellular plasticity in glioblastoma remain poorly understood. Here, using machine learning (ML) we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression using a combination of epigenetic features (ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq) of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to another one suggesting that the epigenetic signals governing gene transcription are consistent across patients even if GSCs can be very different. We demonstrate that H3K27Ac is the epigenetic feature providing the most significant contribution to cross-patient prediction of gene expression. In addition, using H3K27Ac signals from patients-derived GSCs, we can predict gene expression of human neural crest stem cells suggesting a shared developmental epigenetic trajectory between subpopulations of these malignant and benign stem cells. Our cross-patient ML/DL models determine weighted patterns of influence of epigenetic marks on gene expression across patients with glioblastoma and between GSCs and neural crest stem cells. We propose that broader application of this analysis could reshape our view of glioblastoma tumor evolution and inform the design of new epigenetic targeting therapies.">

        <tr id="Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the relative expansion of mutant clones, is derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with acquired somatic or cytogenetic alterations that improve cellular fitness. Individuals with CH have a higher risk for hematological and non-hematological diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, and have an overall higher mortality rate. Originally thought to be restricted to a small fraction of elderly people, recent advances in single-cell sequencing and bioinformatics have revealed that CH with multiple expanded mutant clones is universal in the elderly population. Just a few years ago, phylogenetic reconstruction across the human lifespan and novel sensitive sequencing techniques showed that CH can start earlier in life, decades before it was thought possible. These studies also suggest that environmental factors acting through aberrant inflammation might be a common theme promoting clonal expansion and disease progression. However, numerous aspects of this phenomenon remain to be elucidated and the precise mechanisms, context-specific drivers, and pathways of clonal expansion remain to be established. Here, we review our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms driving CH and specifically focus on how pro-inflammatory factors affect normal and mutant HSC fates to promote clonal selection.">

        <tr id="The global incidence of cancer is increasing, with estimates suggesting that there will be 26 million new cases and 17 million deaths per year by 2030. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key to the resistance and advancement of cancer. They play a crucial role in tumor dynamics and resistance to therapy. CSCs, initially discovered in acute myeloid leukemia, are well-known for their involvement in tumor initiation, progression, and relapse, mostly because of their distinct characteristics, such as resistance to drugs and the ability to self-renew. EVs, which include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, play a vital role in facilitating communication between cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). They have a significant impact on cellular behaviors and contribute to genetic and epigenetic changes. This paper analyzes the mutually beneficial association between CSCs and EVs, emphasizing their role in promoting tumor spread and developing resistance mechanisms. This review aims to investigate the interaction between these entities in order to discover new approaches for attacking the complex machinery of cancer cells. It highlights the significance of CSCs and EVs as crucial targets in the advancement of novel cancer treatments, which helps stimulate additional research, promote progress in ideas for cancer treatment, and provide renewed optimism in the effort to reduce the burden of cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) remains a rapidly lethal complication for late-stage melanoma patients. The inaccessible nature of the disease site and lack of understanding of the biology of this unique metastatic site are major barriers to developing efficacious therapies for patients with melanoma LMD. Here, we characterize the tumor microenvironment of the leptomeningeal tissues and patient-matched extra-cranial metastatic sites using spatial transcriptomics analyses in clinical specimens, with extensive in vitro and in vivo validation. We show the spatial landscape of melanoma LMD to be characterized by a lack of immune infiltration and instead exhibit a higher level of stromal involvement. We show that the tumor-stroma interactions at the leptomeninges activate pathways implicated in tumor-promoting signaling, mediated through upregulation of SERPINA3 at the tumor-stroma interface. Our functional experiments establish that the meningeal stroma is required for melanoma cells to survive in the CSF environment and that these interactions lead to a lack of MAPK inhibitor sensitivity in the tumor. We show that knocking down SERPINA3 or inhibiting the downstream IGR1R/PI3K/AKT axis results in re-sensitization of the tumor to MAPK-targeting therapy and tumor cell death in the leptomeningeal environment using in vitro and in vivo models. Our data provides a spatial atlas of melanoma LMD, identifies the tumor-promoting role of meningeal stroma, and demonstrates a mechanism for overcoming microenvironment-mediated drug resistance unique to this metastatic site.">

        <tr id="Therapeutic resistance is the leading cause of treatment failure and death from cancer. While resistance can be driven by genetic mutations, mounting evidence also points to an epigenetic basis of resistance. Much of this epigenetic, or non-genetic, resistance has been attributed to drug-resistant transcriptional cell states that are either induced by drug treatment or pre-exist in a fraction of cells selected by treatment. However, the extent to which long-term resistance is manifested in the early inherent cellular response to drugs is poorly understood, and which aspects, if any, of this early response to drug-induced transcriptional response are evolutionarily conserved properties of cells. To address these questions, we integrate datasets of long-term drug resistance and early drug response data across multiple cell lines with drug response and resistance data from bacteria and yeast. Our findings suggest that cancer cell states in both the drug-naive populations as well as in populations shortly after treatment share transcriptional properties with fully established resistant cell populations, and CRISPR-cas9 knockout of transcription factors predicted to regulate the resistant transcriptional programs result in inceased drug sensitivity. Furthermore, the resistance states manifested as early drug response are evolutionarily conserved. Finally, we show that early resistant states discriminate responders from non-responders across multiple human cancer trials.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy is becoming a cornerstone of tumour immunotherapy. It relies on the relatively long-term (> 2 week) ex vivo expansion of T cells either in the form of tumour-infiltrating cells, or bulk cells modified with the expression of heterologous signalling proteins, e.g., chimeric antigen receptors. However, relatively little is known about the developmental trajectories of T cells under these conditions at the system level, or whether the pathways governing these trajectories could be manipulated for clinical advantage. Using bulk RNA-seq analysis of T cells expanded and rested over a 17-day period, we produce a resource revealing how gene expression changes as cells transition through distinct cellular states over the course of activation and ex vivo expansion. By integrating this resource with published single-cell RNA-seq data, we identify a member of the AP1 transcription factor (TF) family, FOSL1, that primes CD8+ T-cells towards an effector/killing phenotype. Remarkably, FOSL1 over-expression during T-cell expansion produced ‘super engager-like’ T-cells, evidenced by their gene-expression signatures and enhanced cancer-cell killing capacity. This establishes proof-of-principle for the rational engineering of T cells via TF modification during ex vivo expansion, offering a route to improving adoptive T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Cancer genomic studies have identified frequent alterations in components of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non- Fermenting) chromatin remodeling complex including SMARCA4 and ARID1A. Importantly, clinical reports indicate that SMARCA4-mutant lung cancers respond poorly to immunotherapy and have dismal prognosis. However, the mechanistic basis of immunotherapy resistance is unknown. Here, we corroborated the clinical findings by using immune-humanized, syngeneic, and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer harboring SMARCA4 deficiency. Specifically, we show that SMARCA4 loss caused decreased response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy associated with significantly reduced infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, we show that SMARCA4 loss in tumor cells led to profound downregulation of STING, IL1β and other components of the innate immune system as well as inflammatory cytokines that are required for efficient recruitment and activity of immune cells. We establish that this deregulation of gene expression is caused by cancer cell-intrinsic reprogramming of the enhancer landscape with marked loss of chromatin accessibility at enhancers of genes involved in innate immune response such as STING, IL1β, type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, we observed that transcription factor NF-κB binding motif was highly enriched in enhancers that lose accessibility upon SMARCA4 deficiency. Finally, we confirmed that SMARCA4 and NF-κB co-occupy the same genomic loci on enhancers associated with STING and IL1β, indicating a functional interplay between SMARCA4 and NF-κB. Taken together, our findings provide the mechanistic basis for the poor response of SMARCA4-mutant tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy and establish a functional link between SMARCA4 and NF-κB on innate immune and inflammatory gene expression regulation.">

 What are the molecular and cellular features that contribute to the transformation of myometrial stem cells into tumor-initiating cells within uterine leiomyoma?



 Transformative changes in differentiation and genetic processes, in a distinct subset of M/LM cells drives their progression into a tumorigenic state.



 Uterine leiomyomas (LM), which are benign smooth muscle-derived tumours of myometrium, impact approximately 75% of women, causing significant physical and psychological challenges and imposing substantial healthcare costs. The widespread consensus postulates a monoclonal origin for LM, implying their derivation from a dysregulated single multipotent stem cell that could give rise to tumor-initiating cells (TICs). While previous studies have shown cellular heterogeneity in both myometrium (M) and LM, the precise identity of the originating cells is unknown.



 Prospective, observational, and biomedical study conducted at Hospital La Fe (Valencia, Spain) for one year. Eight sample pairs of LM and M underwent single-nuclei RNAseq (snRNA-seq; n = 16) and single-cell proteomic (scP; n = 16) analyses, to generate a detailed transcriptomic and proteomic map decoupled from cell type, state, and spatial location. We further employed single-cell RNA velocity inference for differentiation trajectory [BR1] analysis of mesenchymal cells, followed by the identification of potential driver genes in LM tumorigenesis.



 Upon obtaining informed consent, we procured LM and M samples from eight patients aged 35-50 undergoing hysterectomies. Part of these samples were preserved in paraffin for spatial transcriptomics utilizing VISIUM (10x Genomics). The remaining tissues were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and underwent scRNA-seq and scP using Chromium Controller and Orbitrap Eclipse Tribid mass spectrometry, respectively. The analysis of the collected data was carried out using publicly accessible R/Python tools.



 Analysis of snRNAseq (∼52,000 cells) revealed similar cellular compositions in M and LM, including endothelial, perivascular, smooth muscle cells (SMC), fibroblasts, and immune cells. Further trajectory analysis unveiled a subset of myometrial cells with potential as TICs, exhibiting reduced expression of hormone receptors like PGR. Analysis of these cells [BR1] suggested differentiation into two distinct cell types -fibroblasts and SMCs- with elevated hormone expression over pseudotime. Differential analysis between M and LM also showed a dysregulated transcriptomic profile in the TICs within the tumor, as evidenced by upregulation of RAD51B and HMGA2 and downregulation PGR among other genes. These genes are indicative markers, underscoring their significant roles in the tumorigenesis of LM by influencing hormone response and disrupting DNA repair mechanisms. Spatial transcriptomic analysis confirmed these findings and suggested that the distribution of TICs could be ubiquitous, since the expression of potential myometrial-stem markers, was markedly increased only on certain spots within the tissue across both LM and M. Lastly, scProt profiling (∼5,000 cells) also allowed the identification of putative TICs, which showed upregulation in LM of specific proteins involved in replication, transcription, and translation.



 Our study sets the basis for TICs isolation in LM, yet functional validation studies need to be performed to address the clinical potential of our findings. Further studies including more patients, and addressing racial disparities will help to generalize these findings to a broader population.



 Our findings indicate the presence of a particular subset of M/LM cells whose changes in differentiation path and genetic processes seem to drive the transformation of these cells into a tumorigenic state to develop LM. Targeting these markers might show promise for effectively treating these tumors.

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a B cell lymphoma that occurs primarily in young adults and, less frequently, in elderly individuals. A hallmark of cHL is the exceptional scarcity (1-5%) of the malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells within a network of non-malignant immune cells. Molecular determinants governing the relationship between HRS cells and their proximal microenvironment remain largely unknown.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We performed spatially resolved multiplexed protein imaging and transcriptomic sequencing to characterize HRS cell states, cellular neighborhoods, and gene expression signatures of 23.6 million cells from 36 newly diagnosed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and EBV-negative cHL tumors.


RESULTS
We show that MHC-I expression on HRS cells is associated with immune inflamed neighborhoods containing CD8+ T cells, MHC-II+ macrophages, and immune checkpoint expression (i.e., PD-1 and VISTA). We identified spatial clustering of HRS cells, consistent with the syncytial variant of cHL, and its association with T cell excluded neighborhoods in a subset of EBV-negative tumors. Finally, a subset of both EBV-positive and EBV-negative tumors contained regulatory T cells high neighborhoods harboring HRS cells with augmented proliferative capacity.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study links HRS cell properties with distinct immunophenotypes and potential immune escape mechanisms in cHL.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequently diagnosed skin cancer and the most common malignancy in humans. Different morphological subtypes of BCC are associated with low- or high-risk of recurrence and aggressiveness, but the underlying biology of how the individual subtypes arise remains largely unknown. Because the majority of BCCs appear to arise from mutations in the same pathway, we hypothesized that BCC development, growth and invasive potential is also influenced by the tumor microenvironment and in particular by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their secreted factors.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to characterize the stroma of the different BCC subtypes with a focus on CAF populations.


METHODS
To investigate the stromal features of the different BCC subtypes, we applied laser-capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNA sequencing. A cohort of 15 BCC samples from 5 different "pure" subtypes (superficial, nodular, micronodular, sclerosing and basosquamous; n=3 each) were selected and included in the analysis. Healthy skin was used as a control (n=6). We confirmed the results by immunohistochemistry. We validated our findings in two independent, public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets and by RNAscope.


RESULTS
The stroma of the different BCC subtypes have distinct gene expression signatures. Nodular and micronodular seem to have the most similar signatures, while superficial and sclerosing the most different. By comparing low- and high-risk BCC subtypes, we observed that Collagen 10A1 (COL10A1) is overexpressed in the stroma of sclerosing/infiltrative and basosquamous but not micronodular high-risk subtypes. Those findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 89 different BCC and 13 healthy skin samples. Moreover, scRNAseq analysis of BCCs of two independent datasets showed that the COL10A1-expressing population of cells is associated with the stroma adjacent to invasive BCC and shows extracellular matrix remodeling features.


CONCLUSION
We identified COL10A1 as a marker of high-risk BCC, in particular of the sclerosing/infiltrative and basosquamous subtypes. We demonstrated at the single cell level that COL10A1 is expressed by a specific CAF population associated with the stroma of invasive BCC. This opens up new tailored treatment options as well as a new prognostic biomarker for BCC progression.">

        <tr id="A distinct feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prominent tumor microenvironment (TME) with remarkable cellular and spatial heterogeneity that meaningfully impacts disease biology and treatment resistance. The dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and the dense stromal compartment leads to spatially and temporally heterogeneous metabolic alterations, such as acidic pH that contributes to drug resistance in PDAC. Thus, monitoring the extracellular pH metabolic fluctuations within the TME is crucial to predict and to quantify anticancer drug efficacy. Here, a simple and reliable alginate-based 3D PDAC model embedding ratiometric optical pH sensors and cocultures of tumor (AsPC-1) and stromal cells for simultaneously monitoring metabolic pH variations and quantify drug response is presented. By means of time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) coupled with a fully automated computational analysis, the extracellular pH metabolic variations are monitored and quantified over time during drug testing with gemcitabine, folfirinox, and paclitaxel, commonly used in PDAC therapy. In particular, the extracellular acidification is more pronounced after drugs treatment, resulting in increased antitumor effect correlated with apoptotic cell death. These findings highlight the importance of studying the influence of cellular metabolic mechanisms on tumor response to therapy in 3D tumor models, this being crucial for the development of personalized medicine approaches.">

        <tr id="MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that are often dysregulated in many diseases, including cancers. They are highly tissue-specific and stable, thus, making them particularly useful as biomarkers. As the spatial transcriptomics field advances, protocols that enable highly sensitive and spatially resolved detection become necessary to maximize the information gained from samples. This is especially true of miRNAs where the location their expression within tissue can provide prognostic value with regard to patient outcome. Equally as important as detection are ways to assess and visualize the miRNA's spatial information in order to leverage the power of spatial transcriptomics over that of traditional nonspatial bulk assays. We present a highly sensitive methodology that simultaneously quantitates and spatially detects seven miRNAs in situ on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. This method utilizes rolling circle amplification (RCA) in conjunction with a dual scanning approach in nanoliter well arrays with embedded hydrogel posts. The hydrogel posts are functionalized with DNA probes that enable the detection of miRNAs across a large dynamic range (4 orders of magnitude) and a limit of detection of 0.17 zeptomoles (1.7 × 10-4 attomoles). We applied our methodology coupled with a data analysis pipeline to K14-Cre Brca1f/fTp53f/f murine breast tumors to showcase the information gained from this approach.">

Moreover, in-depth studies of early tumor-driving events are limited because of the lack of appropriate models. Herein, we analyzed RNA sequencing data obtained from human neuroblastoma samples and found that loss of expression of trunk neural crest–enriched gene MOXD1 associates with advanced disease and worse outcome. Further, by using single-cell RNA sequencing data of human neuroblastoma cells and fetal adrenal glands and creating in vivo models of zebrafish, chick, and mouse, we show that MOXD1 is a determinate of tumor development. In addition, we found that MOXD1 expression is highly conserved and restricted to mesenchymal neuroblastoma cells and Schwann cell precursors during healthy development. Our findings identify MOXD1 as a lineage-restricted tumor-suppressor gene in neuroblastoma, potentiating further stratification of these tumors and development of novel therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Targeted imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis remains challenging due to its highly heterogeneous molecular and phenotypic diversity. Herein, we introduced triple-targeted protein nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to three targets for imaging cancer lymphatic metastasis, through a data-driven design approach combined with a synthetic biology-based assembly strategy. Specifically, to address the diversity of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), a combination of three targets, including C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was identified, leveraging machine leaning-based bioinformatics analysis and examination of lymphatic metastatic tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Using this identified target combination, ferritin nanocage-based nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to all three targets were designed through the self-assembly of genetically engineered ferritin subunits using a synthetic biology approach. Multiplexed imaging of heterogeneous metastatic LNs using these nanoprobes resulted in approximately 80% binding with heterogeneous tumor cells, which was 60% higher than that of single-targeted nanoprobes in a polyclonal lymphatic metastasis animal model. In 19 freshly resected human gastric specimens, the signal from the triple-targeted nanoprobes significantly differentiated metastatic LNs from benign LNs, in high accordance with pathological examination. This study not only provides an effective nanoprobe for imaging highly heterogeneous lymphatic metastasis but also proposes a potential strategy for guiding the design of targeted nanomedicines for cancer lymphatic metastasis.

        <tr id="Structural variants (SVs) represent a mechanism by which cancer cells activate oncogenes or disrupt the function of genes with tumor suppressor roles. A recent study by the PCAWG Consortium investigated structural variants in 30 tumor types, identifying focal rearrangements in the oncogenic BRD4 gene in ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers. These rearrangements resulted in decreased BRD4 expression despite increased copy number, suggesting a novel mechanism to finetune gene over-expression. In this study, we show that focal deletions of BRD4 disrupt genomic regulatory regions and impact gene isoform expression in breast and ovarian tumors when compared to their expression across normal tissues. To determine the functional impact of these concomitant amplification and focal deletion events, we first leveraged open-reading-frame (ORF) screen data from 16 cancer cell lines, where we observed that overexpression of BRD4-long and BRD4-short isoforms is toxic for cancer cell growth. We confirmed these results in OVSAHO ovarian cancer cells, where overexpression of both isoforms significantly reduced tumor growth. Next, we mimicked the focal deletions occurring in BRD4 regulatory regions by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and observed that their depletion functionally ablates tumor cell growth. We finally show that these focal deletions rescue ovarian carcinoma cells from the toxicity effects associated with gene overexpression, suggesting that global BRD4 gene expression levels must be fine tuned to ensure proper cancer cell proliferation. Our study provides experimental evidence for BRD4 deletions constituting the first example of a driver SV alteration reducing toxicity in cancer, therefore expanding the landscape of cancer progression mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the kidney, presenting significant challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Macrophages play crucial roles in RCC, promoting tumor progression and warranting further investigation. Previous studies have identified LHFPL2 as a transmembrane protein associated with reproduction, but its relationship with tumors or macrophages has not been discussed. This study utilized transcriptomic sequencing data from 609 KIRC patients in the TCGA database and single-cell sequencing data from 34,326 renal carcinoma cells for subsequent analysis. We comprehensively evaluated the expression of LHFPL2 and its relationship with clinical features, tumor prognosis, immune infiltration, and mutations. Additionally, we further assessed the correlation between LHFPL2 and macrophage M2 polarization using single-cell data and explored its potential as a cancer therapeutic target through molecular docking. The results demonstrated that LHFPL2 is upregulated in RCC and associated with poor survival rates. In clinical staging, the proportion of malignant and high-metastasis patients was higher in the high-LHFPL2 group than in the low-LHFPL2 group. Furthermore, we found that LHFPL2 influences RCC immune infiltration, with its expression positively correlated with various immune checkpoint and M2-related gene expressions, positively associated with M2 macrophage infiltration, and negatively correlated with activated NK cells. Moreover, LHFPL2 showed specific expression in macrophages, with the high-expression subgroup exhibiting higher M2 polarization, hypoxia, immune evasion, and angiogenesis scores, promoting tumor progression. Finally, we predicted several potential drugs targeting LHFPL2, such as conivaptan and nilotinib. Our analysis elaborately delineates the immune characteristics of LHFPL2 in the tumor microenvironment and its positive correlation with macrophage M2 polarization, providing new insights into tumor immunotherapy. We also propose potential FDA-approved drugs targeting this gene, which should be tested for their binding effects with LHFPL2 in future studies.">

        <tr id="The aging of mammalian ovary is accompanied by an increase in tissue fibrosis and heightened inflammation. Myeloid cells, including macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, play pivotal roles in shaping the ovarian tissue microenvironment and regulating inflammatory responses. However, a comprehensive understanding of the roles of these cells in the ovarian aging process is lacking. To bridge this knowledge gap, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and flow cytometry analysis to functionally characterize CD45+ CD11b+ myeloid cell populations in young (3 months old) and aged (14-17 months old) murine ovaries. Our dataset unveiled the presence of five ovarian macrophage subsets, including a Cx3cr1lowCd81hi subset unique to the aged murine ovary. Most notably, our data revealed significant alterations in ANNEXIN and TGFβ signaling within aged ovarian myeloid cells, which suggest a novel mechanism contributing to the onset and progression of aging-associated inflammation and fibrosis in the ovarian tissue.">

        <tr id="Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare congenital disease in which fragile vascular malformations (VM) – including small telangiectasias and large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) – focally develop in multiple organs. There are few treatment options and no cure for HHT. Most HHT patients are heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations affecting Endoglin (ENG) or Alk1 (ACVRL1); however, why loss of these genes manifests as VMs remains poorly understood. To complement ongoing work in animal models, we have developed a fully human, cell-based microphysiological model based on our Vascularized Micro-organ (VMO) platform (the HHT-VMO) that recapitulates HHT patient VMs. Using inducible ACVRL1 -knockdown, we control timing and extent of endogenous Alk1 expression in primary human endothelial cells (EC). Resulting HHT-VMO VMs develop over several days. Interestingly, in chimera experiments AVM-like lesions can be comprised of both Alk1-intact and Alk1-deficient EC, suggesting possible cell non-autonomous effects. Single cell RNA sequencing data are consistent with microvessel pruning/regression as contributing to AVM formation, while loss of PDGFB implicates mural cell recruitment. Finally, lesion formation is blocked by the VEGFR inhibitor pazopanib, mirroring positive effects of this drug in patients. In summary, we have developed a novel HHT-on-a-chip model that faithfully reproduces HHT patient lesions and that can be used to better understand HHT disease biology and identify potential new HHT drugs.">

        <tr id="Most melanomas progress from radial to vertical growth phase before spreading locoregionally and distally. Much is still unknown about the metabolic changes in the tumor cells and their microenvironment during this metastatic progression. We aimed to gain new insight into the molecular characteristics of melanoma in regard to spatial lipidomics to deliver new knowledge regarding tumor metastatic progression. We included 10 fresh tumor samples from 10 patients including two in situ melanomas, two invasive primary melanomas, and six metastatic melanomas (four in-transit metastases and two distant metastases). In addition, we analyzed four healthy skin controls from the same patients. Time-of-flight imaging secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) enabled detailed spatial-lipidomics that could be directly correlated with conventional histopathological analysis of consecutive H&E-stained tissue sections. Significant differences in the lipid profiles were found in primary compared to metastatic melanomas, notably an increase in phosphatidylethanolamine lipids relative to phosphatidylinositol lipids and an increase in GM3 gangliosides in the metastatic samples. Furthermore, analysis of the data from in transit versus distant metastases samples highlighted that specific phospholipids, and a difference in the long versus shorter chain GM3 gangliosides, discriminated the metastatic routes. Further studies are warranted to verify these preliminary findings. Lipidomic changes could serve as a novel biomarker for tumor progression and even serve as a target for novel treatments. Furthermore, analyzing the lipid profiles could help to differentiate between primary and metastatic melanomas in challenging cases.">

 Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that bind to two distinct surface antigens on cancer cells are emerging as an appealing therapeutic strategy in cancer immunotherapy. However, considering the vast number of surface proteins, experimental identification of potential antigen pairs that are selectively expressed in cancer cells and not in normal cells is both costly and time-consuming. Recent studies have utilized large bulk RNA-seq databases to propose bispecific targets for various cancers. However, co-expressed pairs derived from bulk RNA-seq do not necessarily indicate true co-expression of both markers in the malignant cell. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can circumvent this issue but the issues in low-coverage of transcripts impede the large-scale characterization of co-expressed pairs.



 We present a computational pipeline for bsAbs target identification which combines the advantages of bulk and scRNA-seq while minimizing the issues associated with using these approaches separately. We select Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) as a case study to demonstrate the utility of the approach. First, using the bulk RNA-seq samples in the OCTAD database, we identified target pairs that most distinctly differentiate tumor cases from healthy controls. Next, we confirmed our findings on the scRNA-seq database comprising 39,361 healthy cells from vital organs and 18,000 cells from HCC. The top pair was GPC3∼MUC13, where both genes are co-expressed on the surface of over 30% of malignant HCCs and have very low expression in other cells. Finally, we leveraged the emerging spatial transcriptomic to validate the co-expressed pair in situ.

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Co-occurring mutations in KEAP1 and STK11KRAS have emerged as determinants of survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immunotherapy. However, these mutational contexts identify a fraction of non-responders to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We hypothesized that KEAP1 wild-type tumors recapitulate the transcriptional footprint of KEAP1 mutations, and that this KEAPness phenotype can determine immune responsiveness with higher precision compared to mutation-based models.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The TCGA was used to infer the KEAPness phenotype and explore its immunological correlates at the pan-cancer level. The association between KEAPness and survival outcomes was tested in two independent cohorts of advanced NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy and profiled by RNA-Seq (SU2C n=153; OAK/POPLAR n=439). The NSCLC TRACERx421 multi-region sequencing study (tumor regions n=947) was used to investigate evolutionary trajectories.


RESULTS
KEAPness-dominant tumors represented 50% of all NSCLCs and were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to KEAPness-free cases in independent cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy (SU2C PFS P=0.042, OS P=0.008; OAK/POPLAR PFS P=0.0014, OS P<0.001). Patients with KEAPness tumors had survival outcomes comparable to those with KEAP1-mutant tumors. In the TRACERx421, KEAPness exhibited limited transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity and immune exclusion, resembling the KEAP1-mutant disease. This phenotypic state occurred across genetically divergent tumors, exhibiting shared and private cancer genes under positive selection when compared to KEAP1-mutant tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified a KEAPness phenotype across evolutionary divergent tumors. KEAPness outperforms mutation-based classifiers as a biomarker of inferior survival outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous blood cancer with a dismal prognosis. It emanates from leukemic stem cells (LSCs) arising from the genetic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). LSCs hold prognostic value, but their molecular and immunophenotypic heterogeneity poses challenges: there is no single marker for identifying all LSCs across AML samples. We hypothesized that imaging flow cytometry (IFC) paired with artificial intelligence-driven image analysis could visually distinguish LSCs from HSCs based solely on morphology. Initially, a seven-color IFC panel was employed to immunophenotypically identify LSCs and HSCs in bone marrow samples from five AML patients and ten healthy donors, respectively. Next, we developed convolutional neural network (CNN) models for HSC-LSC discrimination using brightfield (BF), side scatter (SSC), and DNA images. Classification using only BF images achieved 86.96% accuracy, indicating significant morphological differences. Accuracy increased to 93.42% when combining BF with DNA images, highlighting differences in nuclear morphology, although DNA images alone were inadequate for accurate HSC-LSC discrimination. Model development using SSC images revealed minor granularity differences. Performance metrics varied substantially between AML patients, indicating considerable morphologic variations among LSCs. Overall, we demonstrate proof-of-concept results for accurate CNN-based HSC-LSC differentiation, instigating the development of a novel technique within AML monitoring.">

        <tr id="The intricate composition, heterogeneity, and hierarchical organization of the human bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment (HME) present challenges for experimentation, which is primarily due to the scarcity of HME-forming cells, notably bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). The limited understanding of non-hematopoietic cell phenotypes complicates the unraveling of the HME’s intricacies and necessitates a precise isolation protocol for systematic studies. The protocol presented herein puts special emphasis on the accuracy and high quality of BMSCs obtained for downstream sequencing analysis. Utilizing CD45 and CD235a as negative markers ensures sufficient enrichment of non-hematopoietic cells within the HME. By adding positive selection based on CD271 expression, this protocol allows for selectively isolating the rare and pivotal bona fide stromal cell population with high precision. The outlined step-by-step protocol provides a robust tool for isolating and characterizing non-hematopoietic cells, including stromal cells, from human bone marrow preparations. This approach thus contributes valuable information to promote research in a field that is marked by a scarcity of studies and helps to conduct important experimentation that will deepen our understanding of the intricate cellular interactions within the bone marrow niche.

        <tr id="RNA modification pathways are mis-regulated in multiple types of human cancer. To comprehensively identify cancer-relevant RNA modifications and their regulators, we screened all 150 annotated human RNA modifying proteins across 18 different normal and cancer cell lines using a CRISPR-based genetic knockout system. Fifty RNA modifying proteins were essential for survival of at least one cell type. A third of these essential genes were amplified in 38 different human primary cancer types and potentially drive cancer growth. Unexpectedly, the number of essential genes per cell line varied considerably, and this variation was not due to tissue of origin. Instead, we found that cancer cell-specific mitochondrial metabolic plasticity was responsible for the unique requirement of certain RNA modifications. For example, leukemia cells with high intrinsic drug tolerance required mitochondrial flexibility to survive treatment with the anti-leukemic drugs cytarabine and venetoclax. Synthetic lethality screens revealed that drug-resistance is abolished by deleting the mitochondrial methyltransferase TRMT5, which is responsible for the formation of N1-methylguanosine (m1G) in the tRNA anticodon loop. In summary, our study identifies cancer-relevant RNA modifying enzymes, and reveals a novel promising drug target for therapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive, aggressive brain cancer that carries a median survival of 15 months and is resistant to standard therapeutics. Recent studies have demonstrated that intratumoral heterogeneity plays a critical role in promoting resistance by mediating tumor adaptation through microenvironmental cues. GBM can be separated into two distinct regions—a core and a rim, which are thought to drive specific aspects of tumor evolution. These differences in tumor progression are regulated by the diverse biomolecular and biophysical signals in these regions, but the acellular biophysical characteristics remain poorly described. This study investigates the mechanical and ultrastructural characteristics of the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) in patient-matched GBM core and rim tissues. Seven patient-matched tumor core and rim samples and one non-neoplastic control were analyzed using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence imaging to quantify mechanical, ultrastructural, and ECM composition changes. The results reveal significant differences in biophysical parameters between GBM core, rim, and non-neoplastic tissues. The GBM core is stiffer, denser, and is rich in ECM proteins hyaluronic acid and tenascin-C when compared to tumor rim and non-neoplastic tissues. These alterations are intimately related and have prognostic effect with stiff, dense tissue correlating with longer progression-free survival. These findings reveal new insights into the spatial heterogeneity of biophysical parameters in the GBM tumor microenvironment and identify a set of characteristics that may correlate with patient prognosis. In the long term, these characteristics may aid in the development of strategies to combat therapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive tumor with unmet therapeutic needs, which can be explained by extensive intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the specific metabolic features of Glioblastoma stem cells (GSC), a rare tumor subpopulation involved in tumor growth and therapy resistance.


METHODS
We conducted comprehensive analyses of primary patient-derived GBM cultures and GSC-enriched cultures of human GBM cell lines using state-of-the-art molecular, metabolic and phenotypic studies.


RESULTS
We showed that GSC-enriched cultures display distinct glycolytic profiles compared with differentiated tumor cells. Further analysis revealed that GSC relies on pyruvate carboxylase activity for survival and self-renewal capacity. Interestingly, inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase led to GSC death, particularly when the glutamine pool was low, and increased differentiation. Finally, while GSC displayed resistance to the chemotherapy drug etoposide, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase restored etoposide sensitivity in GSC, both in vitro and in orthotopic murine models.


CONCLUSION
Our findings demonstrate the critical role of pyruvate carboxylase in GSC metabolism, survival and escape to etoposide. They also highlight pyruvate carboxylase as a therapeutic target to overcome therapy resistance in GBM.">

        <tr id="Despite immense interest in biomarker applications of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from blood, our understanding of their physiological population in healthy humans remains limited. Using imaging and multiplex bead-based flow cytometry, we comprehensively quantified circulating EVs with respect to their cellular origin in a large cohort of healthy blood donors. We assessed coefficients of variations to characterise their biological variability and explored demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors contributing to this variability. Cell-specific circulating EV subsets show a wide range of concentrations, which do not directly reflect concentrations of blood cells, indicating diverse patterns of EV subset release and/or uptake, even for EVs originating from the same cell type. Interestingly, tetraspanin+ circulating EVs largely originate from platelets and to a lesser extent from lymphocytes. PCA and association analyses demonstrate high biological inter-individual variability in circulating EVs across healthy humans, which can be only partly explained by the influence of sex, menopausal status, age and smoking on specific circulating EV and/or tetraspanin+ circulating EV subsets. No global influence of the explored subject’s factors on circulating EVs was detected. Our findings provide the first comprehensive, quantitative data towards the cell-origin atlas of blood EVs, with important implications in the clinical use of EVs as biomarkers of disease.">

        <tr id="Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, incurable, and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Early MCL diagnosis and treatment is critical and puzzling due to inter/intra-tumoral heterogeneity and limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We developed and applied a multifaceted analysis of selected publicly available transcriptomic data of well-defined MCL stages, integrating network-based methods for pathway enrichment analysis, co-expression module alignment, drug repurposing, and prediction of effective drug combinations. We demonstrate the “butterfly effect” emerging from a small set of initially differentially expressed genes, rapidly expanding into numerous deregulated cellular processes, signaling pathways, and core machineries as MCL becomes aggressive. We explore pathogenicity-related signaling circuits by detecting common co-expression modules in MCL stages, pointing out, among others, the role of VEGFA and SPARC proteins in MCL progression and recommend further study of precise drug combinations. Our findings highlight the benefit that can be leveraged by such an approach for better understanding pathobiology and identifying high-priority novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, drug targets, and efficacious combination therapies against MCL that should be further validated for their clinical impact.">

As drivers in pediatric brain tumors, and in several other types of cancers, oncohistones brought a “new dimension of Strange” into the cancer multiverse, to paraphrase Marvel. An integrative approach to cancer complexity as a multidimensional projection is urgently needed to consider all relevant etiological, developmental, and evolutionary components.

 Multiple therapies with immune mechanisms of action such as CAR T-cells and bispecific antibodies are now approved for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). The efficacy of these therapies is likely influenced by lymphoma microenvironment (LME) characteristics, but these have not been directly characterized in a comprehensive fashion. We therefore performed single-nucleus multiome (RNA + ATAC), bulk RNA, and WES of 119 biopsies from 114 patients to capture both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. After stringent quality control, 970,239 cells remained. Non-B-cell lineages were classified into 76 transcriptionally-distinct cell types using unsupervised clustering. LME archetypes were defined by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of non-B cell types. Associations with CAR T-cell outcomes were validated using published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 clinical trial. NMF clustering identified 5 cellular modules: lymph-node 1 [LN1] and lymph-node 2 [LN2] that are characterized by lymph-node structural cell types, antigen presenting cells and naïve and memory T-cells; T-effector/exhausted [TEX] characterized by high frequencies of effector and exhausted CD8 T-cells; and fibroblast/macrophage 1 [FMAC1] and 2 [FMAC2] that were characterized by high frequencies of macrophage subsets and fibroblast subsets including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The pairs of LN1 and LN2 modules, and FMAC1 and FMAC2 modules, were correlated and therefore considered collectively in tumor archetype construction, resulting in three major archetypes: LN (33% of tumors), TEX (25% of tumors) and FMAC (42% of tumors). Among these biopsies, 17 were obtained immediately prior to, and 13 were subsequent to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Although numbers were limited, these cases suggested that the LN archetype was associated with greater benefit from CAR T cell therapy. We therefore leveraged our bulk RNA-sequencing data plus published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in second line rrLBCL to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier for these archetypes. Evaluation of response data from ZUMA7 showed that the greatest benefit for axi-cel compared to chemotherapy was observed within the LN subtype (HR=0.18; P<0.0001), compared to the FMAC (HR=0.4; P<0.0001) and TEX (HR=0.71; P=0.23), with median PFS in the axi-cel arm of 30.16, 4.94, and 4.53 months respectively. Furthermore, LN subtype patients had significantly better outcomes compared to FMAC and TEX subtype patients in the axi-cel arm (HR=0.5, P=0.006) but not in the chemotherapy arm (HR=1.3; P=0.23). Therefore, accurate construction of the rrLBCL LME using direct cell measurements of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells with single-cell genomics permits the identification of cell types, cell modules, and LME archetypes with important implications for LBCL biology, and may present an opportunity for LME-guided selection of patients most likely to benefit from cellular therapy.

        <tr id="Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare disease associated with a poor prognosis, primarily due to early recurrence and metastasis. An important feature of this condition is microvascular invasion (MVI). However, current predictive models based on imaging have limited efficacy in this regard. This study employed a random forest model to construct a predictive model for MVI identification and uncover its biological basis. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and proteome sequencing were performed. The area under the curve of the prediction model in the validation set was 0.93. Further analysis indicated that MVI-associated tumor cells exhibited functional changes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and lipid metabolism due to alterations in the NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. Tumor cells were also differentially enriched for the IL-17 signaling pathway. There was less infiltration of SLC30A1+ CD8+ T cells expressing cytotoxic genes in MVI-associated ICC, whereas there was more infiltration of myeloid cells with attenuated expression of the MHC II pathway. Additionally, MVI-associated intercellular communication was closely related to the SPP1-CD44 and ANXA1-FPR1 pathways. These findings resulted in a brilliant predictive model and fresh insights into MVI.">

Here, we leveraged the well-defined differentiation states during T-cell development to pinpoint the initiation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive form of childhood leukemia, and study the emergence of phenotypic plasticity. Single-cell whole genome sequencing of leukemic blasts was combined with multiparameter flow cytometry to couple cell identity and clonal lineages. Irrespective of genetic events, leukemia-initiating cells altered their phenotypes by differentiation and de-differentiation. Construction of phylogenies of individual leukemias using somatic mutations revealed that phenotypic diversity is reflected by the clonal structure of the cancer. The analysis also indicated that the acquired phenotypes are heritable and stable. Together, these results demonstrate a transient period of plasticity during leukemia initiation where phenotypic switches appear unidirectional.">

 Background: The intratumoral microbiome is a tumor-specific component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including microorganisms localized inside and around cancer cells and immune cells (Nejman Science2020), which was recently added to the “Hallmarks of Cancer” (Hanahan, Cancer Discovery 2022). Specific intratumoral microbiome signatures (IMS) can be detected using our targeted sequencing platform Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) (Prashkin Nat Comm 2023) data through the implementation of a specific bioinformatic pipeline (Vanderbilt J Mol Diagn 2022, Abate Ann Surg 2022). In lymphoma, where antigen stimulation is known to promote lymphomagenesis, studying the intratumoral microbiome might inform lymphoma biology and potentially new treatment strategies. In anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a specific histologic phenotype can be found in a very diverse spectrum of diseases, ranging from smoldering lymphomas such as breast-implant associated (BIA-ALCL) and primary cutaneous (pcALCL) to systemic aggressive lymphomas such as ALK-positive or ALK-negative ALCL. We hypothesized that the different IMS might be present in different ALCL clinical presentations.
 Methods: We used metagenomic techniques to analyze IMS on MSK-IMPACT-HEME as previously described (Vanderbilt J Mol Diagn 2022) of patients with ALCL in our lymphoma database. All patients signed informed consent. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of each intra-lymphoma IMS in one ALCL subtype compared to that of the same IMS in the other ALCL subtypes. We used several different analyses to process the data for commensals and contaminants. In this regard, we built a database of potentially pathogenic or commensal microorganisms integrated in the decontam (R package) pipeline dataset. For BIA-ALCL, we compared the IMS results with those of known components of explanted textured implant biofilm.
 Results: We re-analyzed the MSK-IMPACT-HEME BAM files of 58 patients with ALCL, including 12 BIA-ALCL, 11 pcALCL, and 35 systemic ALK+/- ALCL. After reviewing the data for commensals and contaminants, we could identify more than one potentially lymphoma-specific or site-specific microorganism in pcALCL (n=2) and in BIA-ALCL (n=14) (slow-growing subtypes) compared with systemic ALCL. Fewer differences were noted between pcALCL and BIA-ALCL; however, Achromobacter and Rothia were significantly enriched in BIA-ALCL compared to systemic ALCL and pcALCL (OR 14.9 p=0.001; OR=5, p=0.025) and Micromonospora in pcALCL compared to BIA-ALCL and systemic ALCL (OR=5.5, p=0.05). No specific IMS was found in systemic ALCL, as the only potentially enriched IMS (Delftiae) is likely a contaminant.
 Conclusions: This analysis of IMS using targeted sequencing data, highlighted some possible associations between intratumoral microorganisms and lymphoma-specific subtypes, especially in indolent subtypes of ALCL (BIA- and pc-) compared to systemic ALCL. Further analyses with more cases and confirmatory techniques might confirm these initial findings.

        <tr id="Medulloblastoma (MB) stands as one of the prevalent malignant brain tumors among pediatric patients. Despite its prevalence, the intricate interplay between the regulatory program driving malignancy in MB cells and their interactions with the microenvironment remains insufficiently understood. Leveraging the capabilities of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), the chromatin accessibility landscape is unveiled across 59,015 distinct MB cells. This expansive dataset encompasses cells belonging to discrete molecular subgroups, namely SHH, WNT, Group3, and Group4. Within these chromatin accessibility profiles, specific regulatory elements tied to individual subgroups are uncovered, shedding light on the distinct activities of transcription factors (TFs) that likely orchestrate the tumorigenesis process. Moreover, it is found that certain neurotransmitter receptors (NTRs) are subgroup-specific and can predict MB subgroup classification when combined with their associated transcription factors. Notably, targeting essential NTRs within tumors influences both the in vitro sphere-forming capability and the in vivo tumorigenic capacity of MB cells. These findings collectively provide fresh insights into comprehending the regulatory networks and cellular dynamics within MBs. Furthermore, the significance of the TF-NTR regulatory circuits is underscored as prospective biomarkers and viable therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Background: Intermediate cell carcinoma (Int-CA) is a rare and enigmatic primary liver cancer characterized by uniform tumor cells exhibiting mixed features of both HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Despite the unique pathological features of int-CA, its molecular characteristics remain unclear yet. Methods: RNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing profiling were performed on int-CA tumors and compared with those of HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Int-CAs unveiled a distinct and intermediate transcriptomic feature that is strikingly different from both HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The marked abundance of splicing events leading to intron retention emerged as a signature feature of int-CA, along with a prominent expression of Notch signaling. Further exploration revealed that METTL16 was suppressed within int-CA, showing a DNA copy number–dependent transcriptional deregulation. Notably, experimental investigations confirmed that METTL16 suppression facilitated invasive tumor characteristics through the activation of the Notch signaling cascade. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular landscape of int-CA featured by METTL16 suppression and frequent intron retention events, which may play pivotal roles in the acquisition of the aggressive phenotype of Int-CA.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in antitumoral and antiviral responses. Yet, cancer cells can alter themselves or the microenvironment through the secretion of cytokines or other factors, hindering NK cell activation and promoting a less cytotoxic phenotype. These resistance mechanisms, often referred to as the “hallmarks of cancer” are significantly influenced by the activation of oncogenes, impacting most, if not all, of the described hallmarks. Along with oncogenes, other types of genes, the tumor suppressor genes are frequently mutated or modified during cancer. Traditionally, these genes have been associated with uncontrollable tumor growth and apoptosis resistance. Recent evidence suggests oncogenic mutations extend beyond modulating cell death/proliferation programs, influencing cancer immunosurveillance. While T cells have been more studied, the results obtained highlight NK cells as emerging key protagonists for enhancing tumor cell elimination by modulating oncogenic activity. A few recent studies highlight the crucial role of oncogenic mutations in NK cell-mediated cancer recognition, impacting angiogenesis, stress ligands, and signaling balance within the tumor microenvironment. This review will critically examine recent discoveries correlating oncogenic mutations to NK cell-mediated cancer immunosurveillance, a relatively underexplored area, particularly in the era dominated by immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells. Building on these insights, we will explore opportunities to improve NK cell-based immunotherapies, which are increasingly recognized as promising alternatives for treating low-antigenic tumors, offering significant advantages in terms of safety and manufacturing suitability.">

        <tr id="Ovarian carcinoma (OC) is a prevalent gynecological malignancy associated with high recurrence rates and mortality, often diagnosed at advanced stages. Despite advances in immunotherapy, immune exhaustion remains a significant challenge in achieving optimal tumor control. However, the exploration of intratumoral heterogeneity of malignant epithelial cells and the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment is still limited, hindering our comprehensive understanding of the disease.Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we comprehensively investigated the cellular composition across six ovarian cancer patients with omental metastasis. Our focus centered on analysis of the malignant epithelial cells. Employing CytoTRACE and slingshot pseudotime analyses, we identified critical subpopulations and explored associated transcription factors (TFs) influencing ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, by integrating clinical factors from a large cohort of bulk RNA sequencing data, we have established a novel prognostic model to investigate the impact of the tumor immune microenvironment on ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, we have investigated the condition of immunological exhaustion.Our study identified a distinct and highly proliferative subgroup of malignant epithelial cells, known as C2 TOP2A+ TCs. This subgroup primarily consisted of patients who hadn’t received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer patients with elevated TOP2A expression exhibited heightened sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Moreover, the transcription factor MYBL2 in this subgroup played a critical role in ovarian cancer development. Additionally, we developed an independent prognostic indicator, the TOP2A TCs Risk Score (TTRS), which revealed a correlation between the High TTRS Group and unfavorable outcomes. Furthermore, immune infiltration and drug sensitivity analyses demonstrated increased responsiveness to Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, and Gemcitabine in the Low TTRS Group.This research deepens our understanding of malignant epithelial cells in ovarian cancer and enhances our knowledge of the ovarian cancer immune microenvironment and immune exhaustion. We have revealed the heightened susceptibility of the C2 TOP2A+ TCs subgroup to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and emphasized the role of MYBL2 within the C2 subgroup in promoting the occurrence and progression of ovarian cancer. These insights provide valuable guidance for the management of ovarian cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma, with two subtypes: Fusion-positive RMS (FPRMS), which has the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion gene, and fusion-negative RMS (FNRMS). Despite their distinct characteristics, treatments mainly rely on conventional chemotherapies without considering these differences. This study highlights that FNRMS cells exhibit significantly heightened interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) compared to FPRMS cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of skeletal muscle tissues and RNA sequencing of RMS samples, we identified the upregulation of genes related to cell-ECM interaction and TGFβ signaling in FNRMS compared to FPRMS. We also confirmed enhanced cell-ECM interaction stimulated by TGFβ signaling in FNRMS cells, using confocal reflection microscopy to monitor dynamic cell-ECM interaction and a live-cell sensor to quantitatively assess TGFβ signaling activity. Additionally, we discovered that the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion gene, characteristic of FPRMS, stimulated nitric oxide synthesis, which suppresses TGFβ signaling and reduces cell-ECM interaction. These findings suggest that PAX3-FOXO1 determines the diminished cell-ECM interactions in FPRMS. Experimental data show higher sensitivity of FNRMS to cell-ECM interaction disruption and TGFβ inhibition. Furthermore, the diminished cell-ECM interaction in FPRMS, allowing cells to survive in the ectopic environment through circulation, may partly explain its higher metastatic potential compared to FNRMS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a significant clinical challenge because the long-term benefits of immune checkpoint blockade therapy are limited. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance in HCC is imperative for improving patient prognosis. Design In this study, to systematically investigate the characteristics of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subsets and the dynamic communication among the tumor microenvironment (TME) components regulated by CAF subsets, we generated an HCC atlas by compiling single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets on 220 samples from six datasets. We combined spatial transcriptomics with scRNA-seq and multiplexed immunofluorescence to identify the specific CAF subsets in the TME that determine the efficacy of immunotherapy in HCC patients. Results Our findings highlight the pivotal role of POSTN+ CAFs as potent immune response barriers at specific tumor locations, as they hinder effective T-cell infiltration and decrease the efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, we elucidated the interplay between POSTN+ CAFs and SPP1+ macrophages, whereby the former recruits the latter and triggers increased SPP1 expression via the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated a spatial correlation between POSTN+ CAFs and SPP1+ macrophages, revealing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the immunotherapy response. Notably, we found that patients with elevated expression levels of both POSTN+ CAFs and SPP1+ macrophages achieved less therapeutic benefit in an immunotherapy cohort. Conclusion Our research elucidates light on the role of a particular subset of CAFs in immunotherapy resistance, emphasizing the potential benefits of targeting specific CAF subpopulations to improve clinical responses to immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immunotherapies targeting T cells in solid cancers are revolutionizing clinical treatment. Novel immunotherapies have had extremely limited benefit for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we characterized the immune microenvironment of t(8;21) AML patients to determine how immune cell infiltration status influenced prognosis. Methods Through multi-omics studies of primary and longitudinal t(8;21) AML samples, we characterized the heterogeneous immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and their immune checkpoint gene expression. Further external cohorts were also included in this research. Results CD8+ T cells were enriched and HAVCR2 and TIGIT were upregulated in the CD34+CD117dim%-High group; these features are known to be associated with immune exhaustion. Data integration analysis of single-cell dynamics revealed that a subset of T cells (cluster_2) (highly expressing GZMB, NKG7, PRF1 and GNLY) evolved and expanded markedly in the drug-resistant stage after relapse. External cohort analysis confirmed that the cluster_2 T-cell signature could be utilized to stratify patients by overall survival outcome. Discussion In conclusion, we discovered a distinct T-cell signature by scRNA-seq that was correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Our research provides a novel system for classifying patients based on their immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Drug resistance is still an imminent issue for melanoma patients even after the use of BRAFi/MEKi combination therapy in clinic. Tumor heterogeneity and heterogeneity in treatment responses make it difficult to find consensus genes and pathways in resistance to therapy. This study used an objective method to analyze published gene expression data from pre-treated tumors and drug-resistant tumors, and identified possible targets and markers for resistant tumors, which centered on the PLXNC1 gene, which promotes a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Abstract Melanoma tumors exhibit a wide range of heterogeneity in genomics even with shared mutations in the MAPK pathway, including BRAF mutations. Consistently, adaptive drug resistance to BRAF inhibitors and/or BRAF plus MEK inhibitors also exhibits a wide range of heterogeneous responses, which poses an obstacle for discovering common genes and pathways that can be used in clinic for overcoming drug resistance. This study objectively analyzed two sets of previously published tumor genomics data comparing pre-treated melanoma tumors and BRAFi- and/or MEKi-resistant tumors. Heterogeneity in response to BRAFi and BRAFi/MEKi was evident because the pre-treated tumors and resistant tumors did not exhibit a tendency of clustering together. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed eight genes and two related enriched signature gene sets (matrisome and matrisome-associated signature gene sets) shared by both sets of data. The matrisome was closely related to the tumor microenvironment and immune response, and five out of the eight shared genes were also related to immune response. The PLXNC1 gene links the shared gene set and the enriched signature gene sets as it presented in all analysis results. As the PLXNC1 gene was up-regulated in the resistant tumors, we validated the up-regulation of this gene in a laboratory using vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. Given its role in promoting inflammation, this study suggests that resistant tumors exhibit an inflammatory tumor microenvironment. The involvement of the matrisome and the specific set of immune genes identified in this study may provide new opportunities for developing future therapeutic methods.">

        <tr id="Genome-level clonal decomposition of a single specimen has been widely studied; however, it is mostly limited to cancer research. In this study, we developed a new algorithm CLEMENT, which conducts accurate decomposition and reconstruction of multiple subclones in genome sequencing of non-tumor (normal) samples. CLEMENT employs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with optimization strategies specific to non-tumor subclones, including false variant call identification, non-disparate clone fuzzy clustering, and clonal allele fraction confinement. In the simulation and in vitro cell line mixture data, CLEMENT outperformed current cancer decomposition algorithms in estimating the number of clones (root-mean-square-error = 0.58-0.78 versus 1.43-3.34) and in the variant-clone membership agreement (∼85.5% versus 70.1-76.7%). Additional testing on human multi-clonal normal tissue sequencing confirmed the accurate identification of subclones that originated from different cell types. Clone-level analysis, including mutational burden and signatures, provided a new understanding of normal-tissue composition. We expect that CLEMENT will serve as a crucial tool in the currently emerging field of non-tumor genome analysis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aneuploidy, the presence of an aberrant number of chromosomes, has been associated with tumorigenesis for over a century. More recently, advances in karyotyping techniques have revealed its high prevalence in cancer: About 90% of solid tumors and 50–70% of hematopoietic cancers exhibit chromosome gains or losses. When analyzed at the level of specific chromosomes, there are strong patterns that are observed in cancer karyotypes both pan-cancer and for specific cancer types. These specific aneuploidy patterns correlate strongly with outcomes for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis formation, immune evasion and resistance to therapeutic treatment. Despite their prominence, understanding the basis underlying aneuploidy patterns in cancer has been challenging. Advances in genetic engineering and bioinformatic analyses now offer insights into the genetic determinants of aneuploidy pattern selection. Overall, there is substantial evidence that expression changes of particular genes can act as the positive selective forces for adaptation through aneuploidy. Recent findings suggest that multiple genes contribute to the selection of specific aneuploid chromosomes in cancer; however, further research is necessary to identify the most impactful driver genes.

        <tr id="Background Many cancers metastasize to the pleura, resulting in effusions that cause dyspnea and discomfort. Regardless of the tissue of origin, pleural malignancies are aggressive and uniformly fatal, with no treatment shown to prolong life. The pleural mesothelial monolayer is joined by tight junctions forming a contained bioreactor-like space, concentrating cytokines and chemokines secreted by the mesothelium, tumor, and infiltrating immune cells. This space represents a unique environment that profoundly influences tumor and immune cell behavior. Defining the pleural secretome is an important step in the rational development localized intrapleural immunotherapy. Method We measured cytokine/chemokine content of 252 malignant pleural effusion (MPE) samples across multiple cancers using a 40-analyte panel and Luminex multiplexing technology. Results Eleven analytes were consistently present in concentrations ≥ 10.0 pM: CXCL10/IP10 (geometric mean = 672.3 pM), CCL2/MCP1 (562.9 pM), sIL-6Rα (403.1 pM), IL-6 (137.6 pM), CXCL1/GRO (80.3 pM), TGFβ1 (76.8 pM), CCL22/MDC (54.8 pM), CXCL8/IL-8 (29.2 pM), CCL11/Eotaxin (12.6 pM), IL-10 (11.3 pM), and G-CSF (11.0 pM). All are capable of mediating chemotaxis, promotion of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, or immunosuppression, and many of are reportedly downstream of a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade mediated by cytokine IL-6 and its soluble receptor. Conclusion The data indicate high concentrations of several cytokines and chemokines across epithelial cancers metastatic to the pleura and support the contention that the pleural environment is the major factor responsible for the clinical course of MPE across cancer types. A sIL-6Rα to IL-6 molar ratio of 2.7 ensures that virtually all epithelial, immune and vascular endothelial cells in the pleural environment are affected by IL-6 signaling. The central role likely played by IL-6 in the pathogenesis of MPE argues in favor of a therapeutic approach targeting the IL-6/IL-6R axis.">

        <tr id="Preclinical models that replicate patient tumours as closely as possible are crucial for translational cancer research. While in vitro cancer models have many advantages in assessing tumour response therapy, in vivo systems are essential to enable evaluation of the role of the tumour cell extrinsic factors, such as the tumour microenvironment and host immune system. The requirement for a functional immune system is particularly important given the current focus on immunotherapies. Therefore, we set out to generate an immunocompetent, transplantable model of colorectal cancer suitable for in vivo assessment of immune-based therapeutic approaches. Intestinal tumours from a genetically engineered mouse model, driven by expression of a Pik3ca mutation and loss of Apc, were transplanted into wild type C57BL/6 host mice and subsequently passaged to form a novel syngeneic transplant model of colorectal cancer. Our work confirms the potential to develop a panel of mouse syngeneic grafts, akin to human PDX panels, from different genetically engineered, or carcinogen-induced, mouse models. Such panels would allow the in vivo testing of new pharmaceutical and immunotherapeutic treatment approaches across a range of tumours with a variety of genetic driver mutations.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The distinct functions of immune cells in atherosclerosis have been mostly defined by preclinical mouse studies. Contrastingly, the immune cell composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and their contribution to disease progression is only poorly understood. It remains uncertain whether genetic animal models allow for valuable translational approaches.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to define the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The human immune cell repertoire demonstrated an unexpectedly high heterogeneity and was dominated by cells of the T-cell lineage, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Bioinformatical integration with 7 mouse scRNA-seq data sets from adventitial and atherosclerotic vascular tissue revealed a total of 51 identities of cell types and differentiation states, of which some were only poorly conserved between species and exclusively found in humans. Locations, frequencies, and transcriptional programs of immune cells in mouse models did not resemble the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerosis. In contrast to standard mouse models of atherosclerosis, human plaque leukocytes were dominated by several T-cell phenotypes with transcriptional hallmarks of T-cell activation and memory formation, T-cell receptor-, and pro-inflammatory signaling. Only mice at the age of 22 months partially resembled the activated T-cell phenotype. In a validation cohort of 43 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the abundance of activated immune cell subsets in the plaque defined by multi-color flow cytometry associated with the extend of clinical atherosclerosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Integrative scRNA-seq reveals a substantial difference in the immune cell composition of murine and human carotid atherosclerosis - a finding that questions the translational value of standard mouse models for adaptive immune cell studies. Clinical associations suggest a specific role for T-cell driven (auto-) immunity in human plaque formation and -instability.">

        <tr id="Brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma (GBM), are devastating and challenging to treat, with a low 5-year survival rate of only 6.6%. Mouse models are established to understand tumorigenesis and develop new therapeutic strategies. Large-scale genomic studies have facilitated the identification of genetic alterations driving human brain tumor development and progression. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) with clinically relevant genetic alterations are widely used to investigate tumor origin. Additionally, syngeneic implantation models, utilizing cell lines derived from GEMMs or other sources, are popular for their consistent and relatively short latency period, addressing various brain cancer research questions. In recent years, the success of immunotherapy in specific cancer types has led to a surge in cancer immunology-related research which specifically necessitates the utilization of immunocompetent mouse models. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of GEMMs and syngeneic mouse models for adult brain tumors, emphasizing key features such as model origin, genetic alteration background, oncogenic mechanisms, and immune-related characteristics. Our review serves as a valuable resource for the brain tumor research community, aiding in the selection of appropriate models to study cancer immunology.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background PIK3CA mutations are implicated in various cancers, but the implications of multiple concurrent mutations and their orientations within the gene have not been fully explored. Methods In this study, we analyzed multi‐PIK3CA mutations across a diverse pan‐cancer cohort comprising 3564 tumors. Results Multi‐PIK3CA mutations were present in 10.3% of all PIK3CA‐mutant tumors, predominantly occurring in breast and gynecological cancers. Notably, mutations within the helical domain (E542:E545) exclusively occurred in the trans‐orientation, contrasting with mutations in the kinase ABD and C2 domains, which mainly appeared in the cis orientation. Conclusions The distinct pattern of mutation orientations in PIK3CA suggests variable oncogenic potential, with helical domain mutations in the trans‐orientation potentially being less oncogenic. These findings highlight the importance of mutation orientation in the PIK3CA gene as potential biomarkers for targeted therapy. This understanding is crucial for designing clinical trials that leverage PI3K inhibitors, aiming for more effective and precise cancer treatment.">

Here, we report on a physiologically improved, feasible, and cost-efficient EwS cell culture technique employing an advanced medium composition, reduced fetal calf serum, and spheroidal growth. Functional in vitro assays and transcriptome profiling demonstrated that these refined conditions better recapitulate proliferation rates of patient tumors as well as hypoxic conditions relevant for EwS pathophysiology. Moreover, transcriptional signatures associated with the oncogenic activity of the EwS-specific FET::ETS fusion transcription factors in the refined culture conditions were shifted from proliferative towards metabolic gene signatures. The herein presented optimized physiological EwS cell culture technique provides a broadly applicable approach for enhanced in vitro modeling relevant to advancing EwS research and the validity of experimental results. MOTIVATION Cell culture remains the main platform to model EwS for research purposes. Yet, concerns exist about the limitations of standard in vitro techniques to adequately reflect physiological conditions. In this study, we refined EwS cell culture methods to increase modeling capacity while ensuring a practical and cost-effective handling, thereby broadening their applicability within the scientific community.">

        <tr id="The Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family genes are implicated in a wide array of biological functions across various human cancers. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of studies that comprehensively analyze the correlation between TET family members and the molecular phenotypes and clinical characteristics of different cancers. Leveraging updated public databases and employing several bioinformatics analysis methods, we assessed the expression levels, somatic variations, methylation levels, and prognostic values of TET family genes. Additionally, we explored the association between the expression of TET family genes and pathway activity, tumor microenvironment (TME), stemness score, immune subtype, clinical staging, and drug sensitivity in pan-cancer. Molecular biology and cytology experiments were conducted to validate the potential role of TET3 in tumor progression. Each TET family gene displayed distinct expression patterns across at least ten detected tumors. The frequency of Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) in TET genes was found to be 91.24%, primarily comprising missense mutation types, with the main types of copy number variant (CNV) being heterozygous amplifications and deletions. TET1 gene exhibited high methylation levels, whereas TET2 and TET3 genes displayed hypomethylation in most cancers, which correlated closely with patient prognosis. Pathway activity analysis revealed the involvement of TET family genes in multiple signaling pathways, including cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response, hormone AR, PI3K/AKT, and RTK. Furthermore, the expression levels of TET family genes were shown to impact the clinical staging of tumor patients, modulate the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs, and thereby influence patient prognosis by participating in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment, cellular stemness potential, and immune subtype. Notably, TET3 was identified to promote cancer progression across various tumors, and its silencing was found to inhibit tumor malignancy and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity. These findings shed light on the role of TET family genes in cancer progression and offer insights for further research on TET3 as a potential therapeutic target for pan-cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) comprises ∼5% of lung adenocarcinoma. There is no effective therapy for IMA when surgical resection is not possible. IMA is sometimes confused with adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features (SRCC) pathologically since both adenocarcinomas feature tumor cells with abundant intracellular mucin. The molecular mechanisms by which such mucin-producing lung adenocarcinomas develop remain unknown. Methods Using a Visium spatial transcriptomics approach, we analyzed IMA and compared it with SRCC patho-transcriptomically. Combining spatial transcriptomics data with in vitro studies using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we assessed downstream targets of transcription factors HNF4A and SPDEF that are highly expressed in IMA and/or SRCC. Results Spatial transcriptomics analysis indicated that there are 6 distinct cell clusters in IMA and SRCC. Notably, two clusters (C1 and C3) of mucinous tumor cells exist in both adenocarcinomas albeit at a different ratio. Importantly, a portion of genes (e.g., NKX2-1, GKN1, HNF4A and FOXA3) are distinctly expressed while some mucous-related genes (e.g., SPDEF and FOXA2) are expressed in both adenocarcinomas. We determined that HNF4A induces MUC3A/B and TM4SF4 and that BI 6015, an HNF4A antagonist, suppressed the growth of IMA cells. Using mutant SPDEF that is associated with COVID-19, we also determined that an intact DNA-binding domain of SPDEF is required for SPDEF-mediated induction of mucin genes (MUC5AC, MUC5B and AGR2). Additionally, we found that XMU-MP-1, a SPDEF inhibitor, suppressed the growth of IMA cells. Conclusion These results revealed that IMA and SRCC contain heterogenous tumor cell types, some of which are targetable.">

        <tr id="Brain metastases are common in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), suggesting a complex process of cancer spread. The mechanisms enabling TNBC cell adaptation and proliferation in the brain remain unclear. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play a crucial role in communication between breast carcinoma cells and the brain. However, the lack of relevant models hinders understanding of sEV-mediated communication. The present study assesses the impact of brain organoid-derived sEVs (BO-sEVs) on various behaviours of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, chosen as a representative of TNBC in a 3D microfluidic model. Our results demonstrate that 150-200 nm sEVs expressing CD63, CD9, and CD81 from brain organoid media decrease MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, enhance their wound-healing capacity, alter their morphology into more mesenchymal mode, and increase their stemness. BO-sEVs led to heightened PD-L1, CD49f, and vimentin levels of expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting an amplified immunosuppressive, stem-like, and mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, these sEVs also induced the expression of neural markers such as GFAP in carcinoma cells. The cytokine antibody profiling array also showed that BO-sEVs enhanced the secretion of MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 by MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, sEVs significantly enhance the migration and invasion of carcinoma cells toward brain organoids in a 3D organoid-on-a-chip system. Our findings emphasize the potential significance of metastatic site-derived sEVs as pivotal mediators in carcinoma progression and adaptation to the brain microenvironment, thereby unveiling novel therapeutic avenues.">
